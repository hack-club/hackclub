## Goals Of Sponsorship For Hack Club

We're looking to attend events so that we can improve the awareness of the Hack Club brand in the Hackathon community, and by doing so attract more high quality applications.

**We are looking to provide/receive:**

- Mentors
- Workshops
- Hack Club's logo on the hackathon's website
- Talk during opening ceremony
- Have a table to pass out stickers

**We are not looking to provide:**

- Financial support
- Help raising money for the hackathon (ex. introducing them to potential sponsors)

## Stages

### Contacted Us

Streak Boxes should start in this stage. This is for tracking hackathons that have reached out to us.

Here's a template response for hackathons that are not hosted by a Hack Club:

> Hey `NAME`,
>
> Thanks for reaching out! We don't fiscally sponsor hackathons, but we'd love to partner with you. We can provide mentors/stickers and run a workshop for beginner/entry level coders.
>
> Are you available to chat? Would love to hop on a phone call sometime over the next week to figure out the details. How about at `INSERT_TIME`?
>
> Looking forward to it,
> `YOUR_NAME`

A template response for hackathons hosted by a Hack Club is not provided because each response will be different based on your relationship with the organizers.

### Responded

Streak Boxes should be in this stage if Hack Club has sent any response to the hackathon.

Once in this stage it's usually best to just handle each hackathon by ear. There are no template emails or calls to follow. Just make sure to confirm the following:

- [ ] Date of hackathon
- [ ] Time of opening ceremony
- [ ] Location
- [ ] Each [goal][goal-section] is accounted for.

A Box can't pass this stage until all the information is known

### Invited To Event

Streak Boxes should be in this stage if the hackathon has formally invited us to the event and all our [goals][goal-section] are met.

Once in this stage, make sure to send out a calendar invite to anyone on the team going to the hackathon.

### Successful Hackathon

Streak Boxes should be in this stage if the hackathon has been run and each [goal][goal-section] was met.

Once in this stage, make sure to attach photos of the event and a testimonial to the Box.

### Rejected

Any sponsorship plans that fall through for any reason should end up in this stage. Hackathons should also end in this stage if not all the [goals][goal-section] were met.
