## Pre-Founding Timeline

- **(September 2012)** Zach started high school and was immediately frustrated. Wanted to write code with others, but there wasn't a CS class, so he started a club to build the class he wished he had (it was terrible).
- **(~May 2012)** Zach got his first job and started helping build [Football Heroes](http://run-games.com/footballheroes/). Coding was a superpower. Slog away at school during the day, stay up late and work on real code at night. Learned a ton and realized he was a terrible programmer.
- **(September 2013)** Zach went to his first hackathon and started getting involved in the [young hacker community](https://web.archive.org/web/20170315211514/https://www.facebookstories.com/stories/112524/hs-hackers) and met a bunch of other high schoolers that did the exact same thing. There were orgs to help students start volunteering clubs, debate teams, and literally almost any other type of club -- but not coding.
- **(November 2013)** Football Heroes launched and did super well. Coding was a superpower. Maybe Zach doesn't need high school after all? Zach left physical high school and figured out a way to earn credits super quickly with basically no work. Did that instead.
- **(July 2014)** Zach moved out to San Francisco. Had no idea how he was going to make money. Got hired on his second day in the city as the first engineer for [Yo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_(app)). He worked to save up money to start Hack Club.
- **(October 2014)** Hack Club is started! For real!
