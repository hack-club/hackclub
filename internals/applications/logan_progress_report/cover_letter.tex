  \opening{Dear Mr. Richard Logan,}

  I'm pleased to submit our mid-year report to the board of The Reva \& David
  Logan Foundation. The attached document reviews our progress and outlines our
  plans for the coming six months with an eye on 2016 and beyond.

  In brief: we created an early prototype of the ``club in a box'', grew from 36
  to 47 schools, and doubled our presence in foreign countries. Our report
  provides details, reflecting on our initial proposal and goals.

  This upcoming semester we are focusing our attention on 12 clubs---an
  initiative we are calling ``Labs''---to refine a working version of our ``club
  in a box''. Once we've completed that, we will begin global distribution at
  our existing clubs and turn our attention to expansion.

  If the board is pleased with our progress, we would like to request a renewal
  of The Reva \& David Logan Foundation's contribution of \$50,000 to hackEDU to
  support our operations as we refine and deploy our ``club in a box''.

  If you have any questions before sharing with the other board members, please
  don't hesitate to call me directly at [redacted].
