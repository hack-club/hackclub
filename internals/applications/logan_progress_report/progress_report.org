#+TITLE: hackEDU Progress Report
#+LATEX: \newpage
In our original grant proposal we outlined five goals for 2015:

1. Increase the number of student-run high school coding clubs in our network
2. Develop our "club in a box" offering
3. Strengthen connections amongst clubs and devise pathways for members to join
   the larger hackEDU community
4. Leverage partnerships to continue growing our club network
5. Measure our effectiveness and automate our feedback system

The first five sections below indicate our progress on each goal. The following
sections provide more insight into the organization as a whole.
* Increasing the Number of Clubs We Serve
Since submitting our proposal in April, we've expanded our reach by 11 clubs and
two countries, bringing our total reach to 47 clubs across 11 states and 4
countries, reaching an estimated 1,500 students.

#+CAPTION: Current club locations
[[./img/clubs.png]]

We plan to onboard an additional 14 schools during the remainder of 2015. That
brings our total expansion to 25 clubs this year, less than the original 60
planned.

Over the summer we received applicants from as far away as Zimbabwe,
Indonesia, Australia, and Hong Kong. After talking with them, we came to the
conclusion that if we wanted to properly build Hack Clubs in their countries, we
had to have absolute confidence in our "club in a box". We decided to prioritize
quality over quantity.

** Press Coverage
Over the past few months we've been mentioned in the below publications. This
has strengthened our brand in the existing communities of potential club leaders
and helped us reach entirely new audiences.

* Creating Our "Club in a Box"
<<sec:club-in-a-box>>
We've made substantial strides since April creating our "club in a box". One of
those strides has been renaming it to the Hack Club Playbook, which is what
we'll be referring to it as moving forward.

Our design process for creating the club playbook is below.

1. Simulate a club in Hack Camp, our two-week summer program, and create a
   curriculum for the camp that we're confident in
2. Create a Hack Camp Playbook and have high school students lead the camp
   from it
3. Take what we learned from building and running the Hack Camp Playbook and
   work with 12 clubs during the first semester of the 2015 - 2016 school year
   to build the first iteration of the Hack Club Playbook. We're calling this
   team of clubs [[sec:labs][Labs]].
   - /We are currently here./ More details below in the /[[sec:labs][Labs]]/ section.
4. We expect to begin global distribution of the Hack Club Playbook at our
   existing clubs and to turn our attention towards expansion during the second
   semester of the 2015 - 2016 school year.

** Hack Camp
This summer we ran Hack Camp, a two-week summer program, to create the first
iteration of our club playbook.

We brought 30 local high school students from little or no coding
experience to publishing their first websites and games. We had two goals:

1. Create an effective curriculum for running Hack Camp that approximates club
   activities
2. Have high school students replicate Hack Camp, similar to how they would run
   a club

We ran four sessions of Hack Camp, ranging in size from 3 to 12 hackers. The
first three sessions we iterated on versions of our curriculum. For the final
session, we created the "Hack Camp Playbook" and invited previous camp
attendees, along with one of our high school volunteers from LA, to run camp
entirely from that playbook.

The Hack Camp Playbook is our first prototype of the Hack Club Playbook.
*** Camp Applicants
Within weeks of announcing Hack Camp, despite being targeted at local high
school students, we received over 150 applications from 13 states and 5
countries for the 30 spots available.

#+CAPTION: Hack Camp applicants (not shown: Ireland, Jamaica, and New Zealand)
#+NAME: fig:hack_camp_applicant_map
[[./img/hack_camp_applicant_map.png]]

To keep our summer focused, we decided to only work with local students.
*** Curriculum
The format we chose for Hack Camp split camp time into two parts: /workshops/
and /project time/.

- Workshops are written documents that walk hackers through the process of
  building something (generally a type of website, like Instagram). Workshops
  are between 1-2 hours long and are used to introduce new concepts.
- In project time pairs of hackers work on projects together. Projects help
  solidify the hackers' understanding of introduced concepts and help them learn
  independent problem solving skills (like using Google to find answers to their
  coding questions).

Hack Camp days follow the format shown in tables [[tab:week-1]] and [[tab:week-2]].

#+CAPTION: Week 1

We created 5 workshops for Hack Camp.

1. *Portfolio* - Builds a personal portfolio website and gets the hackers set up
   with all of the tools they need for writing code. This also introduces HTML
   and CSS, two of the three languages used to write websites.
2. *Texting* - Builds a website that sends text messages to the hackers' phones
   and introduces the hackers to JavaScript, the final of the three languages
   used to write websites.
3. *Instagram* - Builds a very rudimentary clone of the Instagram app and
   further builds their knowledge of JavaScript.
4. *Messenger* - Builds a real-time chat application and introduces the use of a
   server to build more complex web applications.
5. *To-Do List* - Builds a to-do list and further develops knowledge of using
   servers to create complex web applications.
*** The Hack Camp Playbook
We wanted the final session of Hack Camp to be run by people representative of
our club leaders, so we invited two high school students who were previously
participants of Hack Camp and one of our high school volunteers from LA to come
to San Francisco to run the program from the Hack Camp Playbook we created.

The Hack Camp Playbook consists of three parts:

1. An activity-by-activity schedule for each day
2. Guidelines on running each activity
3. Workshops

*** Camper Feedback
What our participants had to say about Hack Camp:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"It is an understatement to say that hackEDU is one of those experiences that
impacted my life. There's a strict, obvious contrast with high school: a place
full of judgment, an environment that devalues creative freedom, an atmosphere
so lonely with constant glorification of useless issues. It is such a wonderful
thing to know a place so different from that exists."
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"I have always, in the back of my head, known that we should overcome challenges
and push our limits, but I never lived by such thinking until this camp. I
learned that despite the fancifulness of dogma, such as "rising up to the
challenge and learning from mistakes," those lessons are actually extremely
true. I was able to live by those lessons through coding because I did indeed
face many challenges and learned from many mistakes. I definitely learned to
lessen my fixed mindset and focus on having a growth mindset thanks to this
camp."
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"The way Hack Camp is taught is totally opposite of what our school system is.
This camp really opened my mind to the different ways that I can learn."
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"In the camp's mere two weeks, more than in any part of my life, not in my days
as a fetus, an infant, a toddler, an elementary schooler, a middle schooler, a
high school freshman, a high school sophomore, or a high school junior, have I
made so many mistakes."
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"The last few hours before presentations, I worked with more intensity and drive
than I ever devoted to schoolwork, and I accomplished great things. I felt
euphoric at the end of each day because I managed to implement a feature I
previously thought impossible to implement. It really taught me that I could
'distort reality' and make things HAPPEN."
#+END_QUOTE

/Some grammar errors in quotes have been corrected./
*** Ratings
When asked "How likely are you to recommend Hack Camp to a friend?" at the end
of the camp, we got the responses shown in table [[tab:hack-camp-ratings]].

#+CAPTION: Hack Camp ratings
#+NAME: tab:hack-camp-ratings
|  Cohort | Average | Median |
|---------+---------+--------|
|       1 | 9/10    | 9/10   |
|       2 | 9.4/10  | 9/10   |
|       3 | 9/10    | 9.5/10 |
|       4 | 8.8/10  | 9/10   |
|---------+---------+--------|
| Overall | 9.05/10 | 9.5/10 |

Overall, we are very pleased with the outcome of Hack Camp. We made great
strides in developing the Hack Club Playbook and camper feedback tells us we hit
the right social, emotional, and community goals. We also generated $5765.00 of
revenue.
** Labs
<<sec:labs>>
Our original goal was to spend the summer building our Hack Club Playbook and
roll it out at the beginning of the 2015 - 2016 school year. After Hack Camp, it
became very clear to us that the only way to get the club experience right is to
build it iteratively as clubs are running.

We've decided to take this current school semester and focus our attention on 12
clubs, an initiative that we're calling Labs. Clubs that are a part of Labs are
the clubs we've selected to build the Hack Club Playbook with us. If all goes
smoothly, in the second semester we'll roll out the playbook at all of our
remaining clubs and create new clubs.

* Strengthening and Expanding the hackEDU Community
In late August we hired a full-time Director of Community, Dave Fontenot, to
strengthen our existing community and to focus on growing it when we set our
sights on expansion.

Dave previously started [[http://mhacks.org/][MHacks]], the largest hackathon in the world, and was key
in bringing hackathons to colleges all around the globe: 50,000 people will
attend collegiate hackathons by the end of this year compared to the estimated
500 attendees in 2012. In addition to MHacks, he started the online community
for collegiate hackathons, [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers][Hackathon Hackers]], which now engages more than 18,000
people and has over 300,000 posts in the past year.

I cannot think of anyone in the world better equipped or more capable than Dave
to fill this position.

** Hello World Posts
One of the ways Dave has started strengthening our community is by encouraging
our leaders to write about their experiences. Selynna Sun, one of our leaders
from Los Altos High School in the Bay Area, published an article about starting
a club and got feedback from alumni encouraging her and offering advice
(https://medium.com/hack-edu/hello-world-431d2040a277).

Jevin Sidhu, a leader from Toronto, had previously written about Cipher, the
coding community he is building in
https://medium.com/cipher-writes/cipher-don-t-code-alone-e38005270844 and shared
it with the club leader Facebook group where it prompted significant discussion.

Harrison Shoebridge from Glenaeon Rudolf Steiner School in Sydney wrote about
his club in https://medium.com/hack-edu/hello-world-3bacfe353bcb. He also shared
it with the club leader Facebook group where it prompted discussion from other
leaders around the world.
* Strategic Partnerships
We furthered our partnership with Hacker Fund to bring coding to underserved
communites around the country through a bus tour. They will be renting a bus and
touring the country giving workshops and running hackathons at high schools.
We'll be one of the organizations providing curriculum. At each school they go
to, they are going to make an effort to leave the school with the foundation for
a Hack Club set up.

We partnered with Galvanize, a network of co-working spaces, and Google to host
Hack Camp over the summer. The program was hosted out of Galvanize's San
Francisco location and a portion of the space was provided by Google for
Entrepreneurs. We've extended this partnership with Galvanize and Google to
secure in-kind office space during the school year.

We are also currently working on a few exciting partnerships with other
organizations in our space. As soon as we have contracts signed, we will update
you.
* Measuring Effectiveness and Automating Feedback Collection
During Hack Camp we placed a very heavy emphasis on feedback and consistently
measuring the quality of each day of camp. We experimented with aggregating all
of the campers' feedback to give us day-to-day insight into the quality of the
experience, as shown in figure [[fig:hack-camp-feedback]].

#+CAPTION: Day-to-day feedback from the third session of Hack Camp
#+NAME: fig:hack-camp-feedback
[[./img/hack_camp_feedback_chart.png]]

As we go into the first semester of the 2015 - 2016 school year, the collection
of data and the automation of an efficient feedback system continues to be very
important to us. We're thinking of the best way to go about this with Labs and
will be working on this over the next few months -- stay tuned for our next
report.
* Additional Accomplishments
** Advisors
As we've progressed these past months, we've been very fortunate to grow and
maintain an exceptionally talented team of advisors.

** Summary
These past few months one of our greatest assets has been focus. Not actively
fundraising allowed us to dedicate the entire team to creating the Hack Club
Playbook and gave us the focus to successfully execute on Hack Camp.

As we enter the 2015 - 2016 school year I believe that mantaining that same
level of focus will be crucial to our success. With our current monthly burn
rate of $9,920.00 (this includes the Director of Community hire) we will run out
of cash March 2016 (in 6 months).

With an additional $50,000 cash infusion we would have until August 2016, giving
us 5 additional months of runway at our current burn rate. This would give us
significantly more time to focus on building and deploying the best club
playbook possible this school year, laying the foundation for all of our impact
in the years to come.
