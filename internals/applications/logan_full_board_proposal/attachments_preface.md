"Hello World" is the name of the first program most new coders write. While
Hello World itself is quite simple---it just displays the words "Hello,
World!"---it means that you were able to successfully communicate through the
computer and that you've embarked on the journey of learning to code.

We asked a subset of our club leaders to write a Hello World blog post to
introduce their clubs to the world earlier this year. I've included a few of
them below.

I hope these give you a peak behind the curtain and share some of what the
hacker experience is and why it's so important to us. Thank you for taking the
time.
