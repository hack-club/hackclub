# Proposal

Hack Club helps high schoolers start awesome after-school coding clubs. We provide everything needed to get started: curriculum, leadership training, community, and events.

In the US alone, 3 in 4 high schools don't offer any coding classes and we're setting out to help students change that. We think coding is a superpower that anyone can learn and our mission is to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic status, the opportunity.

## Our Impact

Since our conception in late 2014, we've grown to over 82 schools, 16 states, and 7 countries, reaching over 1,500 students.

In our latest poll, clubs reported 33% of members to be female (nearly 2x high school average) and 37% of members to be black or Hispanic (7x industry average).

## Our Goals

We want to:

- Increase access to quality coding education
- Bring coding to underrepresented and underserved students
- Dissolve stigmas, stereotypes, and misconceptions around coding

If we're able to accomplish these, not only does that mean a larger and more diverse technology workforce, but it means living in a more empowered world where more people create the change they want to see. And that is a world we want to live in.
