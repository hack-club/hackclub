# Project Management

This is a living document meant to record our current project management practices.

---

Single GitHub project board. Tasks must all follow the INVEST acronym. Don't we love our acronyms.

- **I**ndependent - Should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another task
- **N**egotiable - Not an explicit contract, should leave space for discussion
- **V**aluable - Must developed value to the stakeholders
- **E**stimable - You must always be able to estimate the size of a task
- **S**mall - Should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of accuracy
- **T**estable - The task or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible (i.e. there must be a clear win condition)

See [this Wikipedia page](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)>) for a complete description of INVEST.

If a task doesn't follow INVEST, **it must be removed** from the board. Modify the task to make it compliant.

Three stages on board: **To Do**, **In Progress** and **Done**. Work from left to right, never have more than one item in **In Progress** assigned to you.
