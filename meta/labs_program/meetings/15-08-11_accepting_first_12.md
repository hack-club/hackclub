_In attendance:_

- Jonathan Leung
- Max Wofford
- Zach Latta

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Process of inviting lab members
  - Invite them to be a candidate
  - Give them expectations
  - Experiment with explaining what a detailed schedule might look like
  - Do an interview call
  - If there are any red flags, reject them, otherwise accept them
  - Then have them sign a contract with expectations
- We will not be flying people out to SF
- We'll express the fact that we have an expected 5 hour time commitment outside
  of club
  - Full semester schedule for calls will not be complete and will change
    - Potential wording:
      - We will be constantly iterating what we do
        - We'll be experimenting with group calls
        - Etc.
