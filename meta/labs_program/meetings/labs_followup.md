When I was in high school, my entire world was just the beach in Hollywood,
Florida -- I didn't do shit. Talking to you about the community you're
building at your high school left me feeling inspired for the future of the
world.

As a student who's running a coding club at your high school, you are
paving the way for thousands of students around the world who will start
coding clubs after you. You're setting the new status quo for what people
can expect from high schoolers.

We are going to work day and night to have a decision to you by end of day
Wednesday.

Regardless of whether you become a Labs Director, we want to showcase your
club to the world. If you write a "Hello, World!" draft for your club,
share it with us so we can add it to our new hackEDU Medium publication:
https://medium.com/hack-edu/latest

Also, we love feedback! Have any ideas for hackEDU labs or even just a
better title/description for our Medium publication? Just reply to this
email.
