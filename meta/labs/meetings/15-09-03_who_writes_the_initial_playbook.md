# Who Writes the Initial Draft of the Playbook?

_Date:_
Thursday, September 3rd, 2015

_In attendance_:

- Jonathan Leung <jonathan@hackedu.us>
- Dave Fontenot <dave@hackedu.us>
- Zach Latta <zach@hackedu.us>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Agenda:

### Question to answer:

- For the initial drafts of the *content* of the club playbook for labs program
  (i.e not the scaffolding), who writes the first draft?
  - The hackEDU core team?
  - The hackEDU Lab Directors?

## Conclusion

- Before every meeting, each lab club will
  - submit a pull request detailing what they are planning for their club
    meeting.
- After each meeting _**by the end of the day**_, each lab club will
  - write a medium blog post with post-mortem detailing
    - what went well in the club
    - what didn't go well in the club
    - suggestions for what other club leaders should and shouldn't try
  - make a pull request to append the medium blog post to their initial planning
    file

- Note: All in on GitHub for planning notes and post meeting notes UNLESS, we
  notice a huge delay OR low quality for the post meeting notes.

## Actionable Items

- **@hellyeah**
  - Write the language that communicates how to do [the above](#conclusion) |

    - Here are some notes that Jonathan thought of after the meeting:
      - It was not clear *when* they need to submit the pull request before the
        meeting.
          - Jonathan suggests they should do it at least **3 days** before a
            club meeting so that other leaders have ample time to give them
            feedback on it
      - Also Jonathan thinks that it is a good idea for lab directors to take
        their meeting plans and the post-mortem blog posts and post them
        in the hackEDU leaders group as well as their cohort's chat.
          - Instead of just linking it, they may want to provide a quick TLDR
            so that other leaders can engage with the content without having
            to open the link.

- **@zachlatta**
  - Create a plan for how to make the Github workflow as easy as possible for
    club organizers to submit the plan for their club meetings as well as their
    post-mortem documents | [link to GitHub issue](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/issues/152)
  - Take the language that @hellyeah writes for communicating the expectation of
    making a pull request for your meeting plan and a post mortem as well as
    clearly explaining the GitHub workflow for this. | [link to GitHub issue](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/issues/153)
  - Take back the tasks of starting up the cohort 2 messenger chat and
    scheduling the first call.
  - Make appropriate revisions to https://github.com/hackedu/meta/issues/119
