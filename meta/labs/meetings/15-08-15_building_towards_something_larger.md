# Building Towards Something Larger

_In attendance:_

- Jonathan Leung
- Dave Fontenot

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusions:

- We could do some type of larger competition
  - Perhaps a competition for the school that can get fellow students to ship
    the greatest number of portfolio websites.
- We could also do regional demo days where a given school could host a demo
  day at their school and invite neighboring school. This could be science fair
  style.
