# Initial Brainstorm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of the labs program is to iterate and refine our initial process for
onboarding new clubs with our "club playbook" (what we predict to be the first
6 - 10 weeks of a club).

We'll have higher expectations of our labs clubs than regular clubs. The leaders
of the clubs who are in our labs program will be expected to put in 6 hours
weekly and work closely with us week to week to refine the playbook they'll be
running. The details of what we'd do with them during those 6 hours aren't
refined yet, though potential ideas are:

- Regular calls
- Regular feedback forms
- We sit in on club meetings - perhaps remotely

If the clubs in our labs program want to diverge from our playbook and try their
own thing, they are absolutely welcome to do that, the only caveat being we'd
still have the same time commitment expectations with them and would stay just
as in touch.
