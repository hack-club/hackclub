Personally mentoring to sure up technical strength?

## hackEDU Advantages: what do we offer that HS students want?

Leadership Titles

Diverse co-organizers in the past have had distinct advantages

— x, y, z

## Early Metrics

## hackEDU: marketing for HS clubs

- Posters

- Facebook Group/Event
- Twillo phone call right away
- Showcase what people in the club made
  - you can make this stuff too
- Before/After Posts

## hackEDU: Effective Google Hangouts

Treat everyone equally as remote

- headphones in?

Have an agenda doc/notes doc/use chat?

## hackEDU Research

Lift off the best HS club organizers in the country

- look for a scholarship or some sort of program that already filters these
  people
- could be specific to a certain type of club
- FIRST?

I want to convince these people to write a series of Medium posts about how they
did it.

hackEDU

I need to get on calls with organizers

Select everyone to interview for labs program

- we should do a big blast for this
- i want 2 organizers who have zero club at their school
- get emails of every HS Hacker who has attended a hackathon

Interviews

Sign contracts on labs leaders

What are the challenges a club runs into before the first meeting

- messaging:

- Club leaders
- Samuel
- Johal
- Lowell (tegan, student) — club we run in the city
  - local clubs
  - sam ran hack camp
- Amy
  - new jersey

Ask about them running meetings

Andrea’s last day with us tomorrow

- hack t-shirt design

Design clubs?

Amy is running middle school camp

- michigan girl wanted to do this too?
- jonathan is refactoring workshop

Starting clubs of our own?
- each member of the team running one club
- and having option to run 1 or 2 clubs

Lowell up and running again
- hs student running it running it so we can observe

Another club
- sf university high
- get back in touch with him so we can observe it

Lincoln (another club in SF)

- max run that

Starting 1 more club that core team runs

Actionable Written Objective for each club/labs program

- table discussion for later
- could be actionable for this week

Labs leaders need to be diverse from the start

- we can do a big blast to blow out the funnel there

Need to make sure everyone on the team is technical
- i want to go through the curriculum
- we could use design as a trojan horse too

I could write the club playbook for college

Understanding timeline for clubs

- club fair

Incorporation of what clubs need to do to get ready for club meeting

- club fair day?

Playbook

- leading up to first meeting
  - stickers?

## Early metrics?

   it
