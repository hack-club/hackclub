-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We're going to focus on two schools

    - Will be on Labs team.
    - Meant to set precedents for the rest of the team.
  - South Pasedena High School
    - Going to get them in the interview pipeline
- Existing clubs in LA
  - We can dump resources on them like we're doing with the rest of our clubs
  - Gemma will distribute resources to all of the clubs
- Start building relationships with potential clubs in LA now (so they know that
  something will happen later in the year). We'll do this during Hacktoberfest
  (nothing immediate)
