Subject: hackEDU Labs Decision

After interviewing 30 clubs for hackEDU Labs, we had to make the difficult
decision of selecting the clubs that would be the best fit for the program.
Unfortunately, we decided not to turn your club into a Lab this semester.

That said, we would like to invite your club to hackEDU. We love the community
you're building at your school and want to invite you to join the hackEDU
Leaders community: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1501083703514499]

Introduce yourself by sharing one challenge you know you'll face with your
club this year.

Looking forward to watching the coding community grow at your school, Dave
