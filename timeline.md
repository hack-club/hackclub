## Things To Test

### Direct
- How do you get learners X enough to build their won projects at home?
	- excited
	- know how to self-learn
	- confident
- What's the most effective way to build communities that build things together?
- How do you get people tapped into the larger hacker community?

### Meta
- How do you get people to contribute to building this community?
- How do you package it in a way that makes it very easy to learn?

# Club in a box
- I package it in a way that allows Zach to do it (I have to do it 3 times first, then I package it for Zach who does it once, and then I package it for Max)
- We can service different locations if we stagger meetings






1
) West Coast
2) Figure out where to fire bullets
3) Figure bullets from last week
4) Get clubs interested in hackEDU in the Fall
5) Get more schools interested in applying to hackEDU to create wait queue (figure out what this queue looks like)
6) Recruit for club

### Summer Prep

SIMULATE CLUBS : RECRUIT CLUB ORGANIZERS FOR SUMMER TESTING

RECRUIT CLUB ORGANIZERS FOR CASE STUDIES


FIND LOCATION
- Location
	- Summer School
	- 3rd Party Location
- Timeframe (19 chunks in fall), Summer == 12 weeks
	- Daily, Over 3.8 weeks
	- 3x Per Week, 6.3 weeks 
	- 2x Per Week 10 Weeks
-  Timeframe (22 in spring)

MEETUPS


# Summer Week To Week Goals
1) Run a clubs program over the summer where we test and build a club in a box with the help and advice of all current clubs (create parallel programs that we run), max runs one, jonathan runs one, club leaders run other ones (Amy)
5) Get more schools interested in applying to hackEDU to create wait queue (figure out what this queue looks like)

# Fall Deploy Club In A Box
At new schools, do we want staggering

- User Surveys
- Create a set of questions for every current club leader to answer and develop assumptions from there
- Should we purely focus on exisiting clubs?




## Research Questions

Do user research questions for club leaders on this as first step

(1a) why would you say that you started a programming club at your school

(1b) why do you think other people may want to start a club at their school?

(2) What do are / have been your top 3 biggest blocking factors to starting and running a club?

(3a) How did current members hear about your club?

(3b) What do you think are the reasons why people joined your club?

Create spreadsheet of club leader names


Collect member data


Do user interviews with club members

## Problems

"Finding a club sponsor is huge, and IMO the biggest deal: our club sponsor is amazing, learned coding over the summer just for the club, one of the most likeable and intelligent teachers in the school. Having good projects (our valentines day and march madness and minigame projects) and club events (codeday, hour of code) is big. Computers with all the software a club needs is unlikely (our tech department hasn't installed a *single* thing we've requested since the start of the year. Not even python! Python is like a one-click install) but is really nice. Money isn't really an issue since so much of coding is free, but subscriptions to online tutorials can take a lot of money."
