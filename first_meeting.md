# First Meeting

## Overview

The primary objective of the first meeting is to get everyone to come back
to the second meeting.

You can do this by

- [being extremely welcoming](#be-extremely-welcoming)
- [having every hacker ship something on their first day](#experiencing-success-on-the-first-day)

### Be extremely welcoming

Like at the club fair, continue being extremely welcoming.

Treat everyone like they are the most important guest. Be overly hospitable.

Why? When someone walks into a new room, event, or community, they immediately
have two questions:

- Am I welcome here?
  - Do people even want me to be here?
- Do I belong here?
  - Is this a place where I will have fun?
  - ...where I will learn something interesting?
  - ...where I will make friends?

If you greet people excitedly as a friend, you can answer both of those
questions immediately. If people feel a sense of belonging in your club after
the first meeting, then:

- They will come back to club
- Club will be much more fun

The tendency in clubs is for close friends, especially officers, to clump
together in cliques. This is one of the primary reasons newcomers don't come
back. Cliques make people feel excluded.

It's everyone's job to greet newcomers. Every member should know this by the
time they go to their second meeting. It should be engrained in the culture.

- Every new person should be greeted at the door.
- Start conversations. Ask questions. You want to get students talking about
  what they care about.
- Make sure that the officers don't clump together. Every officer should be
  actively engaging newcomers.

Make sure to go over *explicitly* how to be hospitable with EVERY officer and
EVERY old member. Most people WILL NOT do this by default.
```

### Experiencing success on the first day

Everyone should ship something on their first day at Hack Club. 

This being the first day of club this year, everyone in the entire club
should ship a new website, even if they shipped one previously.

**Why is it so important to ship something on someone's first meeting?**

Let's dive a bit deeper into the problem.

**There are many people that don't think coding is for them.**

This might be because they:

- think that coding must be hard because our culture has this impression that
  you have to be a genius to be able to code.
- think that because they're "bad" at science and math things, they will also be
  bad at coding.
- they either have a conscious or subconscious belief coding is not for them
  - because they are not male
  - because they are not white, east asian, or south asian

By shipping a project on the first day, they have tangible proof to themselves
that they can learn to code. It is impossible to refute that they cannot build
a website because they just did.

Also, it is particularly powerful to have this website published and live on
the internet for the world to see. Creating positive feedback loops around
shipping things (apps, websites, anything concrete) will be crucial to
building a strong Hack Club. Not only is it the key metric of success for a
healthy club, but it also looks great to parents, advisors, and colleges ;)

You want people to leave every Hack Club meeting with something to show.

## Schedule

Here is a sample schedule for a 1 hour meeting:

## Checklist of physical materials

- computer to show the presentation on
- any adapters and cables you need to plug into the projector
- a working internet connection
- make sure that any websites that you want to show are not blocked
- snacks / food that can be eaten at the meeting are always a plus

### Talk about the club

You _could_ use a powerpoint for this but if you do, try to use as few words as possible.

Most slides should have pictures on them, not words.

[See the slide decks of Alexis Ohanion](http://www.slideshare.net/kn0thing/presentations) (the founder of Reddit) and [how he uses them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa_yNfRALkY).

**Potential Outline:**

- **WHY**_ you're running Hack Club
  - share your personal story
- why programming is awesome
- what your club is all about
  - club focus on beginners
  - personal website workshop
  - CodeDay
- club isn't run by the officers. it's run by the members. 
  -"we want feedback from you"

### Socializing and one-on-one time

Make sure that the officers and old club members completely split up and talk
to as many newcomers as possible. Break up cliques as soon as they form. One
on one conversations are desirable because they allow people to open up more.

### Workshop

### Closing up

- thank everyone for coming to the first meeting
- tell them the meeting is over but they are welcome to stay and chat
- personally say good bye to each individual person by name at the door
- let them know that you're excited to see them at the next meeting on
  _date_of_next_meeting_
  - bonus points for giving people a high five on their way out
- if you did a good job, people will stick around afterwards and continue
  talking to you and their new friends
