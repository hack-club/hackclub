# First Meeting

## Overview

The primary objective of the first meeting is to get everyone to come back
to the second meeting.

You can do this by

- [continuing to be extremely welcoming](#continuing-to-be-extremely-welcoming)
- [having every hacker ship something on their first day](#experiencing-success-on-the-first-day)

### Continuing to be extremely welcoming

Like at the club fair, continue
[being extremely welcoming](/club_fair.md#be-extremely-welcoming).

Treat everyone like they are the most important guest. Be overly hospitable.

Why? Because if a newcomer feels like they feel

- welcome in the club
- that they have become friends with people in the club

Then

- they will come back to club
- club will be much more fun

```
Pro-tip!

./)_)
  " "

Make sure to go over *explicitly* how to be hospitable with EVERY officer and
EVERY old member. Know that most people WILL NOT do this by default.

Don't fall into the trap that it is not worth doing or thinking that people will
do this automatically.
```

### Experiencing success on the first day

Everyone should ship something on their first day at Hack Club. It's the job of
anyone else at the club who's been there at least once to help any newcommers
ship that website.

This being the first day of club this year, everyone in the entire club
should ship a new website, even if they shipped one previously.

**Why is it so important to ship something on someone's first meeting?**

Let's dive a bit deeper into the problem.

**There are many people that don't think coding is for them.**

A lot of people for a variety of reasons don't believe that they can learn to
code. This might be because they

- think that coding must be hard because our culture has this impression that
  you have to be a genius to be able to code
- think that because they're "bad" science and math things, they will also be
  bad at coding.
- they either have a conscious or subconscious belief coding is not for them
  - because they are not male
  - because they are not white, east asian, or south asian

By them shipping a project on the first day, it is tangible proof to themselves
that they have the ability to learn to code. It is impossible to refute that
they cannot build a website because they just did.

Also, it is particularly powerful to have this website published and live on
the internet for the world to see.

## Schedule

Here is a sample schedule for a 1 hour meeting:

## Checklist of physical materials

- computer to show the presentation on
- any adapters and cables you need to plug into the projector
- a working internet connection
- make sure that any websites that you want to show are not blocked
- snacks / food that can be eaten at the meeting

### Meet and greet

- Club officers individually mingle with new people
- Make sure that the officers don't clump together.
- Try to get conversations started.
- If new people walk in, make sure that 1 person is designated for greeting
  them introducing them to the people that they were talking with.

Make sure to do the following even for people that come early.

The following sections addresses this with more detail:

#### Greeting People

**Not Ideal**

- everyone is glued to their laptops and not talking
- the club leaders are just huddled in one corner of the room talking amonst themselves and everyone else is just sitting and waiting for something to start
- you tell them to go sit down and open their laptop

**Ideals**

- You have made sure that someone is responsible for greeting newcomers at all
  times!
  - Try to greet the newcomer by their name.
    - Why? It feels good to remembered. It makes them feel valued. It makes
      them want to come back. It makes the club closer.
    - ```
      Note if you want to be really pro, memorize the names of everyone who wrote
      their name on their signup sheet, look up their picture on Facebook, and
      memorize each person's names from their face.
      ```
  - Then warmly welcome them to Hack Club.
  - The entire dialog might look something like:
    - "Hi! Welcome to Hack Club! I'm glad you made it! What's your name?"
    - "Hey Jenelle! Good to see you again! I'm glad you made it!"
- After greeting them, walk around the room with them and introduce them to
  *everyone else* in the room. Make them feel like they belong in the club and
  the people want them there.
  - Why? Because it sucks to be with a group of people that they don't know and
    it feels amazing to feel like you belong and that they want you there.
  - The dialogue might look something like:
    - _The greeter walks the newcomer, Jenelle, over to the closest group of people_
    - "Hey guys! Meet Jenelle!"
    - _A chorus of hellos erupt_
    - "Jenelle, meet Sandy. I just met her at the club fair yesterday!"
    - _Sandy and Jenelle shake hands_
    - "Meet Sally, she's the co-president of Hack Club! She's super nice and
      an awesome to talk to if you want to get into mobile apps!"
    - _Sally and Jenelle shake hands_
    - "Meet Aaron, he joined Hack Camp last year. If you want help making things
      look really pretty, talk to him!"
    - _Aaron and Jenelle shake hands_
    - _The greeter walks Jenelle to the next group of people_
    - "Hey guys! Meet Jenelle!"
    - _Another chorus of hellos erupt_
    - _I face a newcomer that I already forgot the name_
    - "Shoot! I forgot your name already"
    - "Marissa", she replies.
    - "Yes, Marissa! How could I forget! Marissa, meet Jenelle!"
    - "I just met Marissa for the first time 1 minute earlier!"
    - Important note, as I am walking Jenelle around, I need to have made sure
      that someone else is at the door to greet newcomers walking in.

#### After the majority of new people have entered the room

**Not Ideal**

- Go hangout with the people you already know

**Ideal**

- Deliberately talk to the people you've least interacted with.
- Make sure that there is lively conversation in the group of people you're
  talking to.
- Periodically scan the room to notice if there is anyone who doesn't look like
  they feel included. Find a way to try to include any of those people in a
  conversation somewhere.
    - Note this may require you to leave your current conversation and physically
    move over there.

#### Conversation Topics

**Not Ideal**

- ONLY talking and not asking questions
- ONLY talking about coding related topics
- Not sharing anything personal about yourself

**Ideal**

- Get to know your club members below the surface level:
  - Learn what makes them tick
    - ask what they might want to get out of the club
    - ask them what made them want to come
    - ask them some things that they're excited about
    - ask them what they like to do in their spare time
  - Learning what makes them take allows you to not only explain how the club
    could cater to their interests, but deliberately try to do things in their
    club explicitly to cater to their interests.
    - Note that if they give you some suggestions or feedback and you think it's a good idea, the more quickly you act on it, the more satisfied your
    customer will be.

### Talk about the club

You _could_ use a powerpoint for this but if you do, try to use as few words as possible.

Most slides should have pictures on them, not words.

[See the slide decks of Alexis Ohanion](http://www.slideshare.net/kn0thing/presentations) (the founder of Reddit) and [how he uses them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa_yNfRALkY).

**Potential Outline:**

- why programming is awesome
- what your club is all about
  - mention that you have a focus towards beginners
  - we are part of a competition between 12 other schools around the world
    to help as many people at our school make their own personal websites.
  - you will each be leaving with a personal website by the end of the day
  - What CodeDay is, why it's awesome, the date, the location, and that
    EVERYONE in the club is going.
- what projects they will be doing
- that what you will be doing will be changing based on what they want to do
- therefore, they should make sure to speak up and let you know
- Also, that you love feedback so please let us know if anything can be improved
  - We'll be giving you feedback forms regularly to fill out
- _**WHY**_ running a program is important to you personally
  - Sharing this personal story makes people feel more connected with you,
    they start to see you as a human that they can relate to.
- Each officer can introduce themselves saying what their role is and
  why they personally part of Hack Club.

### Socializing and one-on-one time

If all the club leaders made an effort to share vulnerable personal stories
about why they are a part of Hack Club, newcomers will be much more comfortable
sharing their stories to you and each other.

Keep the same ethos of being welcoming as the [meet and greet](#meet-and-greet)
section. The most relevant section is the
[conversation topics section](#conversation-topics).

Make sure that the officers and old club members completely split up and talk to
as many newcomers as possible. A one on one setting is desirable because it
allows people to become more personable.

### Workshop



### Closing up

- thank everyone for coming to the first meeting
- tell them the meeting is over but they are welcome to stay an chat
- personally say good bye to each individual person by name
- bonus points for giving people a high five on their way out
- if you did a good job, people will stick around afterwards and continue
  talking to you and their new friends
