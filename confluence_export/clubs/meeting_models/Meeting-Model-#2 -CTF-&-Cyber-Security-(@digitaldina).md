_Meetings can be tough to run, so here‚Äôs what Dina chose to do with her meetings outside of the typical workshop structure!_

Along with the fact that cyber security is an industry with one of the greatest talent gaps when it comes to technology, I love running cyber security meetings because it's a really fun way to change things up from a typical workshop structure. Plus, you and your club members can finally call yourselves hackermans üòé

# Meeting Planning and Structure

I use the same structure for all my meetings, regardless of topic, because it makes planning easier plus it allows for members to focus on the topic rather than trying to keep up with a structure they aren't used to. You can check out how I do this in detail in [my other article on running hardware and micro:bit workshops](https://www.notion.so/hackclub/Microbits-and-other-Hardware-e63e154ef18240ac934037c2a1311a34). This article won't make much sense unless you get familiar with the way I structure all my meetings, so here's a quick summary:

First 10 minutes: play music, show first slide with Hack Club logo and workshop name, and wait for people to come and settle in. I don't just stand there though; I just chat with the members about school, life, etc.

Next 10-15 minutes: I run through the slides and do the workshop demo. I make sure to note that I'm not going to teach; I'm here to help and share my resources. I'm certainly not smarter or more qualified than half my club members.

Rest of the meeting until 10-15 minutes before the end: Work time! My teacher sponsor and I walk around and help anyone that needs it. Members work on their own versions of the demo.

10-15 minutes before the end: "Sharing Time"! I don't like or use this term, but I just don't know how to describe it in a shorter faster way üòÅ Members share what they made, their idea or solution, and/or their favorite part of the meeting. We vote on the best presentation (not just the best technical work) at the end of the meeting.

_I sometimes bring food ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)_

Also, for context, **you can find the slides I use for this type of meeting [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nZD9XVtys3AVMh4sSXeAmcfcHSuF5iRZVxe2e3DKG-0)**.

# What are CTFs?

The best way to learn about cyber security or anything really is through doing, but at the same time we don't want to be doing anything illegal. CTFs (Capture The Flag competitions) give us a structured and safe environment to test and practice our cyber security skills. CTFs work much like the game Capture the Flag that you may have played as a kid. These competitions are a collection of problems that you have to solve, sometimes with attached files, programs, hints, and resources. You, the hacker, have to try and break into a program, website, etc and get a flag from that program, all while learning about different tools and ways to break into different things! Flags are strings with a certain structure that the competition will specific. For example, picoCTF's format for flags is picoCTF{\_\_\_} The competition website will also have a field where you can enter the flag that you receive in exchange for points, just like stealing a flag from the other team's side gets a point for your team. For a list of great beginner-friendly CTFs, please see this list. Also, if you would like to see what CTFs are currently running or will run, check out [CTF time](https://ctftime.org/).

Just like elementary school. Except if you do CTFs instead of trying to hack on your own, there is no jail!

# Specific differences for a Cyber Security/CTF Meeting

The hardest part of CTFs is knowing what you should be googling since it's hard to identify how you should attack a program in order to find the hidden flag. So, as a part of my demo at the beginning of the meeting, I introduce the cyber security topics, terms, and helpful resources that members will need for the workshop.

Also, since the members are coming up with solutions to problems instead of creating things during the meeting, the "Sharing Time" won't be demos of what the members made during the meeting. Instead, the members will share the coolest problem and/or solution that they solved or tried to solve during the meeting. Again, **it isn't about the most points or the hardest problem solved; rather, it's about who presents their solution in the coolest way**. This levels the playing field for both beginners and wizards in your club. Plus, people will remember that one good thing about the meeting more since they have to recap it before leaving.

# A few last things...

I also tried to cover as much ground as I could when it comes to cyber security workshops without writing a book, but if you feel like I missed something or you've got a specific question, **especially if you have a piece of feedback or suggestion**, feel free to reach out about anything! I'm @digitaldina on the [Hack Club slack](http://hackclub.slack.com) and here's my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/d1g1t4ld1n4). I'm also [@dinaelhanan](http://instagram.com/dinaelhanan/) on most other social media.
