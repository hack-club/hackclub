One of my most challenging meetings was the one on machine learning. The topic is so nuanced, and if not presented properly, I might turn an entire team of club members away from machine learning for the foreseeable future. It's all about condensing math into a way that people can understand with visual aids, Analogies, and props.

# Planning Phase

For the planning phase, I had to make the judgment on whether a meeting on machine learning would be successful. It's not enough whether I have the necessary skills â€“ my club members need to be receptive as well. So, the first order of business was to see what my club thought of the idea. Luckily, they were enthusiastic about the idea, so we decided to move ahead with it. Now a problem that we had was that we didn't really have GPUs or high performing CPUs to do all of the calculations on, and the internet connection was spotty at best. I wanted all my team members to be able to get their hands dirty and actually experiment with the code, so I decided to build a small JavaScript-based neural engine that would run right in your browser. I mean, everyone had a functional browser, so this was the best way forward with the least amount of variables. I would have used Google Collab, but the internet in the computer lab that we were using was so unreliable that there was a good chance that the internet would be too slow to use or be nonexistent altogether. Besides, we were only gonna be running the basics. There was nothing too fancy, and we could afford to wait a few extra seconds. If we needed to allocate a considerable amount of time to processing or training, we could let the models train as we had lunch. As I said, this was nothing fancy; all we needed were 10-20 minutes of training tops.

Before the meeting started, I went over to the computer systems that we'd be using just to make sure that they were all up and running. You can never be too safe. Just for good measure, I added a whiteboard to the room, which turned out to be helpful in explaining everything.

# Meeting Time

You can't learn on an empty stomach, so, as everyone came in, I gave them a Snickers bar. This was the first meeting for a few of them, so I thought this was a nice way to break the ice. With all of them settled in, I started. I didn't go straight to the slides for this one. I started with an analogy; this, I hoped, would help them understand better. The analogy went as follows. "_I suck at math and that's not an understatement. Whenever I'm asked a proof, ie. to prove a theorem or whatnot, I'm stumped. I know I have to convert the stuff I'm given into the answer. I just need to figure out the nitty-gritty stuff that happens in between. That's basically how machine learning works"._ In my experience analogies really help drive the point home. It helps the people who are learning this for the first time to relate to and understand the idea that I'm trying to convey. We've all been stumped in math tests before and I tried to draw on those feelings to help them understand what a neural network does.

# Discussion

Back and forth is incredibly important for our meetings. I want them to respond to my questions and ask me questions as they have them. This facilitates better learning, in my opinion. In my session, they started to learn by themselves as they analyzed and questioned what I taught. They were not being inert listeners like in a typical classroom; they were actively paying attention and contributing to the conversation. The best thing about this conversation was that they took an interest in the topic, and they started posing questions to me, which was great! This also helped them improve their communication skills. It forces them to critically evaluate the things that they've been told and to then verbalize their thoughts or disagreements. This, I feel, helps them grow as a person.

The discussion is also useful for deciding on where to go next. I love to hear what my team members think we should do next, and discussion is a great avenue to showcase all those ideas. This helps build a tight-knit group where everyone feels included and valued!
