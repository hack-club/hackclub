# Synth Music ðŸŽ¶

This challenge makes use of the [Synth Workshop](https://hackclub.com/workshops/synth). Club members will organize into small groups, and with the use of the finished product, attempt to recreate songs.

1. Guide your club members through the workshop. If you would like to skip directly to the action, use the finished product [here](https://synth--polytrope.repl.co/).
2. Form teams! Encourage club members to group themselves into teams of 2 - 4, this is also a great opportunity for members to learn more about each other and is an overall great team-building activity.
3. Start the music! This will be the overall longest part of the challenge. Give members a minimum of 30 minutes to work on their songs.
4. Present! Encourage teams to play their music for everyone, even if it is incomplete.
