Video Overview
--------------

*   The goal of this video is not to (quote end-quote) "teach" you how to run your first meeting, but rather a case study of myself, while I share some tips and lessons I learned throughout. I think these could be extremely helpful for you to easily visualize what a successful first meeting will look like.
    
*   By the end of this video, you should have clear actionable on what you should do to prepare for your first meeting, and a clear goal of what your first meeting should look like, both tailored to what you know about your school.
    

Background Information
----------------------

*   Before I start, I just want to briefly talk about my school's demographics:
    
    *   Rockville, Maryland; suburban DC
        
    *   About 2,300 students in my school, so about 500-600 per grade level; considered a relatively large school
        
    *   On the CS side: every student is required to take at least an introductory technology class before they graduate; a high enrollment rate for the AP Computer Science Principal course, and we also offer a few classes beyond the AP CS A Java course.
        

Preparing for your meeting
--------------------------

*   If you did a great job at advertising your club ahead of time, hopefully, you should have a fat list of attendees on the interest forms.
    
*   If there is a gap longer than a week between your major marketing push and your first meeting, please keep your students updated!
    
    *   Email hype previews
        
    *   Set your first meeting date early
        
    *   Get them to invite their friends
        
*   Know your content!
    
    *   Preview the workshop. Run through it with your co-leaders; if you run into any trouble while setting things up, make sure you ask the community
        
    *   Test the environment. Internet & services must be ok.
        
*   My own case:
    
    *   My school has a club fair before & after the school year starts (the one before school starts is usually after the first football game & before freshman picnic). Although my club (from previous year) met before
        

During the first meeting
------------------------

*   I have had two years of "first meeting" experience
    
    *   First-year (failure case): ran a huge "mission statement" presentation—sucks, people lost interest
        
    *   Second-year (which is what I'm going to primarily talk about): ran a few minutes of introductory speech, and workshops
        
*   I walked into the room with absolutely no idea how many people I would get, but watching the room gradually filling up was a great feeling (although later on the great feeling turning into panicking because we literally ran out of seats)
    
*   But the great thing about planning a workshop: it works for all party sizes
    
    *   Quick introductory speech: welcome, what we do, and potentially fit in an ice-breaker to get everyone to know each other
        
    *   Demographic check: I identified some of the more advanced members in the group, and I was able to pair them with the groups with fewer experiences so they can help each other out.
        
    *   Start the workshop — don't lead it, go through the basics and make members follow the workshop themselves. My staff member and I just floated around the room, mostly helping out the students with fewer experiences
        
    *   Most of the time, when you answer questions, do not directly give them answers. Teach them how to use Google to find the information they need.
        
*   Demo: really important chunk of the meeting, so make sure you leave enough time for that. Every member of my club at least had the basic Orpheus website completed (some had more time, so they worked their own customizations)
    
*   Everyone demos. I told everyone that no matter if you like the website or not, make sure you show some respect and appreciation because there are students in this room who's taking their first step in programming.
    
*   Cheering!!!
    

How do I know if I ran a successful meeting?
--------------------------------------------

*   The most important (and probably one of the only) metric is your club attendance. If your first meeting was successful, members will want to come back.
    
*   Are people off task? If so, make sure you're leading them back on. People might come in to play video games, do homework... prevent them from happening. This behavior may spread.
    
*   If your sponsor is sitting in the room, ask them about it!
    
*   Co-leader huddle after the meeting
    

Thanks for watching! I hope this was helpful in preparing you for your first meeting. Check out other videos on this channel & other articles in the Help Center. More details can be found in the video description/page.
