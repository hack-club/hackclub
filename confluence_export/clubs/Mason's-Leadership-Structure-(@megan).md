The leadership structure for Mason Hack Club has gone through several iterations. I'll be going over all of them here!

# Year 1 (2016-17)

The roles we had in our first year were:

- Executive Director
- Project Director (2)
- Communications Director
- Outreach Director
- Finance Director
- Activities Director

The team size was enormous and not optimal for actual action, but was a good foundation to iterate on. It was mostly this large because of the large co-founding team, though many of our team's original members did not continue their work in the club following their first year.

My takeaways from this were:

- Don't make the team larger the necessary
- Make sure that titles are clear enough to indicate what someone's responsibilities would be

# Year 2 (2017-18)

Roles:

- Executive Director
- Operations Director
- Outreach Director
- Finance Director
- Logistics Officer
- Communications Officer

The roles in our second year of operation were more nuanced, but we still ran into issues with communication and coordination among a team that was too large for its own good. Hierarchies became difficult to understand and truly unnecessary, as you'll see in our third year of operation.

My takeaways for this year were a little bit more clear:

- No useless hierarchies, as you can see in the title difference between Directors and Officers
- Don't create ambiguous titles (what the heck are Logistics vs. Operations??)

# Year 3 (2018-19)

Roles:

- Executive Director
- Operations Director (2)
- Outreach Director (2)
- Finance Director
- Development Director
- Assistant Operations Director (2)
- Assistant Outreach Director
- Assistant Finance Director
- Assistant Development Director

This year's leadership team became enormous, but for a really important reason: the seniors who founded the club would soon be leaving, and we wanted to make sure that we trained our successors to be able to take over the club's operations seamlessly. In hindsight, we didn't need such a massive team, but the titles were much more clear, and through meetings and discussions, the roles of each person were pretty clearly defined by the end of the year. Additionally, having two people in a role was meant to cut down on workload, but ended up making it harder to delegate tasks as people weren't sure who was doing what.

Takeaways:

- Don't overinflate your team, but also don't hesitate to add members to your team for long-term solutions
- Don't have more than one person in a role unless it's clear who's doing what
- You NEED to start thinking about leadership transition much earlier than expected! This should be a discussion that happens, at the latest, in the middle of your junior year
- Assistant positions are an interesting idea but need to be executed extremely well to work. We found that Assistant positions made Director roles less clear and responsibilities were harder to divide up; they also set unclear expectations around inheritance of a Director role to an Assistant Director

# Year 4 (2019-20)

Roles (subject to change still!):

- Executive Director
- Operations Director
- Outreach Director
- Finance Director

The smaller team was decided through long debates, but after reflection on Year 3 and examining the applications we received, we decided it'd be better to have a tighter-knit team with somewhat more responsibilities on each person. Of course, this leadership team could still change...

# Conclusions

Overall, Mason Hack Club had lots of iterations of leadership positions and structures, but I'm personally really happy with how we decided to transition leadership. Hope this helps you decide or reflect on your structure!
