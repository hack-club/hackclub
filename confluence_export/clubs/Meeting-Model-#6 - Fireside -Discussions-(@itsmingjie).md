Sometimes, meetings don’t have to be structured at all!

**Background**
--------------

Some general information about my club: just like almost every other club in my school, my Hack Club always starts off the year with a deadly amount of new members—we had 60+ people stuck in a 30 person room at the first meeting. However, the attendance rate will then start to drop, and stabilize itself at about 15 people per meeting. The number is not high, but this meeting model can totally take advantage of it!

**Idea**
--------

First of all, you need to be sure that you know the interest of your club. It is suggested that you run this meeting format somewhere in the middle of the year—at some time that you’ve already gotten a clear idea of what your club is made up of.

My club is filled with students who are somewhat interested in tech but don’t have a lot of knowledge over it. Perfect timing, we received a bunch of free books from an author who writes about blockchain and bitcoins. Knowing that my club members are probably interested in knowing more about bitcoins & blockchains, I decided to run a casual discussion on them and give these books away at the end.

**Mindset**
-----------

Running a discussion is drastically different than running a workshop. At a workshop, you’re almost like teachers, where you are expected to know more about the content than your members so you can help out. But when you’re facilitating a discussion, you are a part of the discussion, although you’re still in charge of driving the discussion. **You’re not expected to know everything, so be ready to learn with the group!**

**Preparing**
-------------

You’re running a club, not a Socratic Seminar session. Don’t write a full-blown outline for it, but write some lead questions so that you can save the experience in case the discussion cools down.

**The Meeting**
---------------

I jumped into the meeting realizing that my members knew way less than what I expected. There’s no way this conversation would facilitate well without some guidiance information, so instead of directly jumping into the lead questions, I started with a few very basic examples (and analogies) of what bitcoins are. During the discussion, I pulled up my laptop and searched a few things up, and found some awesome articles that made the discussion much easier to participate in.

Eventually, after I got a basic sense that everyone’s at least familiar with the idea, we started assembling our own example of the bitcoin analogy… and things got… funny… and somewhat inappropriate… just like any other high school conversations. You get the point.

If you facilitate it well, you shouldn’t be leading the conversation. The conversation leads itself. The meeting is very easy and low-effort to run—think of it as a conversation you’d have with your friends during lunch.

**Takeaways**
-------------

*   **Do not** overuse this meeting style. This can be a “break” between sessions of workshops, or your last meeting before winter break where few people actually show up to school. Running too many discussions will make you look less responsible for the club and make your overall curriculum for the club less structured.
    
*   **Do not** overthink it. Take it easy—it’s supposed to be a fun moment!
    
*   **Do** make sure you have enough participants for the conversation to be alive. Somewhere around 10 attendees would be preferred.
    
*   **Do** make sure you’re flexible—it’s a free railing discussion, so it can be easily driven off or go too wild. Step in at the right time, but not too much.
