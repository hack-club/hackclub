Here are some suggestions on making sure that your writeup is as amazing as possible!

# Formatting Suggestions

- Add relevant photos to your writeup to illustrate your point — photos of your club meetings, hackathons, leadership meetings, etc. are all helpful
- Make sure that your writeup has good sectioning/paragraphing so that it isn’t one giant block of text
- Format your text with boldface, italics, and underlining wherever you want

# Topic Suggestions

If you want to write, but don't know what to write about...

- Potential writeups can be **stories** about your experiences or **detailed answers** to common questions
- Look at our [Potential Writeup Ideas](Potential-Writeup-Ideas.md) page to find a running list of needed writing about topics, questions, and stories
