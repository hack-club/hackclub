- All writeups should be spelled completely correctly and follow basic grammar/punctuation rules
- All writeups should include the following at the top:
  - Your full name
  - Your Slack username
  - The date that the post was written
  - A title for your post
  - If applicable, the question you were answering and the person who asked the question
- No repeated writeup topics unless you are telling **your** story and/or the content is clearly different
- Writeups, when finished, should be sent as:
  - A Slack message (paste the entire writeup in one message, not super recommended for formatting purposes)
  - A link to a private Notion page
  - A Microsoft Word document
  - A Google Docs link (Link access to commenting would be the best option)
- Make sure that you choose a format. Is your writeup considered:
  - A story
  - A case study
  - An answer to a common question
  - Advice (not recommended; will be deprecated soon)
    
You can read up on each type of format at [Potential Writeup Ideas](Potential-Writeup-Ideas.md).
