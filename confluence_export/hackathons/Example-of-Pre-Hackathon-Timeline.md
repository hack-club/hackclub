# Ten days before

## Find project leaders

Look at who is coming and if you know some of those people are coming with particular projects, identify project leaders. You may also want to meet with them at this time to:

- Guide them on how to make progress on their projects
- Identify how they can take on newcomers, what tasks are doable for newcomers
- Identify what sort of help their project needs

See the section Cultivating Good Projects above.

## Find helpers

If you are running interactive workshops where the participants are following along on their laptops and expect many participants to attend, you may want to have workshop helpers around to help participants that get stuck. Plan for at least one helper for every 10-20 participants.

Also find helpers to run a registration table and the building’s front door if it is locked, and you can also consider identifying volunteers to take point on photography, managing social media, and documenting what happens at the event for storytelling afterward.

## Email attendees

You may want to email the registered attendees at this point with as much of the logistics information as you know, so that they can plan ahead. See “The day before” below for what to include in the email.

# Three days before

## Set up group communication

Set up a way for your participants to communicate digitally and stay in touch after the event. Some options are:

- A chat room, like [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- A social media channel, like a hashtag on Twitter or a Facebook group
- A shared document space, like Google Docs or [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper)
- An email list, like a Google Group

## Think about how you will tell your story

Part of your event’s lasting impact is in how people will remember it:

- Choose a hashtag.
- Set up a [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) or other public shared document space (see above) for projects to record progress and post links.
- Think about [how to take photos of your hackathon](http://paulclarke.com/photography/blog/the-hack-day/) that tell its story.
- Read Nathan Matias and Willow Brugh’s [media-making strategies](https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/media-making-strategies-to-support-community-and-learning-at-hackathons) for hackathons.

## Acquire supplies

You should bring to the event:

- Paper, markers, and tape to write and post signs with
- Name tag stickers and markers for people to write their names on their name tag
- Note cards, pens, paper and other supplies to facilitate project planning
- Plastic cups, paper plates, and disposable utensils if you are providing food

## Also...

- Place any food catering orders
- Email any journalists you know who may be interested in the event
- Charge your camera so you are ready to take photos
- Some venues require a list of participants for security. If you need to submit a list, make sure you alphabetize it! Security will probably print whatever you have as-is and things get complicated quickly when the list is not in order.

## Email attendees again

You may want to email the registered attendees at this point, again, with as much of the logistics information as you know, so that they can plan ahead. See “The day before” below for what to include in the email.

# The day before

## Walk-through

Do a walk-through of your venue. Ensure you have:

- Banquet tables for hacking, rectangular tables for workshops
- Enough chairs (count them!)
- One power strip per table
- Working WiFi
- Working projector and VGA dongle (maybe even test your computer)
- A microphone, at least in large rooms

If you have two parallel tracks:

- Go over the list above once for the hacking room and again for the training room
- Ensure you have enough space to hold everyone in one room because participants will gather in one room first for the welcoming session

## Email blast

Send out a logistics email to registered participants. Include:

- Your contact information, including your cell phone number so participants can call/text you if they cannot find the venue
- Any pre-event and post-event happy hour information: location, date, and time
- Start and end dates and times of the event
- Location of the event (address and building name), exact location of entrance, directions, and map
- Reminder to bring ID if the venue has a security check-in
- Reminder to bring a laptop and charger
- What food/beverages will be provided and when (breakfast, lunch, dinner?), and what restrictions will be accommodated (vegetarian, etc.)
- Schedule of workshops, if applicable
- Your code of conduct (or a link)
- If there are any disability accessibility issues with the venue, include that
- Any read-ahead materials to prepare them for the topic of the event
- Names of the organizers and acknowledgement/thanks to sponsors

## Handouts

Print handouts for participants that include:

- WiFi info (SSID and password)
- The event’s hashtag and URL
- The schedule (start time, lunch, end time, and workshop schedule if applicable)
- A list of breakout rooms
- Recommend nearby locations for lunch/dinner (and include a map if possible)
- A short URL (e.g. bitly) to the tumblr or hackpad page

Print one copy per table (i.e. one copy for every ~5-10 participants).

## Also

- Prepare slides for the welcoming session (if you want)
- Charge your phone. It is going to be a long day tomorrow.
