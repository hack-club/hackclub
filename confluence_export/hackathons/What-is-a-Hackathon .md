# Defined

I define “hackathon” very broadly:

- Hacking is creative problem solving. (It does not have to involve technology.)
- A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to solve problems. Most hackathons I’ve run also have a parallel track for workshops.

Participants typically form groups of about 2-5 individuals, take out their laptops (if the event is technology themed), and dive into problems. Training workshops are a great parallel track especially for newcomers but also for all participants.

# Positive energy

Hackathons have gotten a bad rap because of _some_ that have an unhealthy, competitive structure, and for setting unrealistic expectations. Don’t run a hackathon like that and you’ll be on the right track. Here are the goals I keep in mind:

- Strengthen the community that the hackathon is for.
- Be welcoming to newcomers to the community.
- Provide an opportunity for participants to learn something new.
- Provide a space and a time for participants to make headway on problems they are interested in.

Don’t expect to have actually solved a problem by the end of the hackathon. Real life problems are hard! Think of the hackathon as a pit-stop on a long journey to solve problems or as a training session to prepare participants for solving problems.

Since you’re not going to solve a problem, don’t put unrealistic (and unhealthy) pressure on your participants. Don’t stay up all night, don’t pump participants with caffeine, and don’t make winners and losers. Just don’t. There has never been beer, competitions, or time pressure at my hackathons. Participants should come energized and be greeted with positive energy.

# Wait — maybe a hackathon isn’t the right thing

My notes below are mostly logistical and assume a technology-centric approach. I take it for granted that you want to run a hackathon. But read [So You Think You Want to Run a Hackathon? Think Again](https://medium.com/@elle_mccann/so-you-think-you-want-to-run-a-hackathon-think-again-f96cd7df246a) by Laurenellen McCann for thoughts on other (and sometimes better) ways of engaging a community.

Also consider not calling your event a “hackathon”. Not everyone will know what you mean, and “hacking” might make it [less likely that all groups will feel welcome](https://twitter.com/erinrwhite/status/707956467224190976).

If the goal of your hackathon is to market a product, stop here and read a different guide. Your goals and my goals are not the same.
