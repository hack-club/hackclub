# Basic requirements

Find a venue to host your event and reserve the date. This is the only thing you need to do significantly in advance of the event. The earlier you can reserve space the better.

Find a venue that can provide:

*   Proper seating (see below)
*   One power strip per table
*   Wifi (is it fast and reliable? can it connect all of your participants? does it block any ports?)
*   Projector
*   A microphone, at least in large rooms
*   Accessible entrances and wheelchair-friendly seating space (and if there is a stage, check if it is accessible, if applicable)
*   Gender-neutral, single-occupancy, accessible bathrooms

(If you are running a large event, also read through [all of the accessibility concerns listed here](http://conference.hopper.org.nz/#environment).)

# Seating

Seating requirements are different for hacking and workshops. For hacking, you will want a banquet-style setup with large circular tables that seat about 10 people each. Rooms in banquet-setup hold the _fewest_ number of people compared to other table/chair arrangements, so take that into account when computing capacity. For workshops you will want classroom-style seating, i.e. rectangular tables with chairs on one side.

# Also check...

Check whether the venue permits you to have food in the room.

If holding the event outside of business hours, check that the venue will have air conditioning/heating.

# Budgeting your venue

Professional venues charge quite a bit of money, so you will need to find something that fits your budget. Hopefully you can find some free space with good wifi (your local library, a friend’s company, etc.).

For a large, one-full-day event in a major city, expect venues to change in the thousands of dollars per day. It depends on how much space you need, and there is no rhyme or reason to pricing, but it usually comes out to about $10-$30 per person.

# When

Choose the date of your event carefully. Avoid the summer, holidays, and other major events in your field. Weekends are hard for people who are attending in their professional capacity. Weeknights are hard for parents.

Ask your venue about permissible start and end times. Set times for when you will arrive/leave and for when participants will arrive/leave. Plan at least 30 minutes before and after the event for you to set up and tear-down/cleanup.

Make sure you can get in and that your participants can get in. If the building’s front door is locked, make sure you have a key and that you have someone posted at the door to let in participants (you may need a team of people to rotate at the front door throughout the day).
