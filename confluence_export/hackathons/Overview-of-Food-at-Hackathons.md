Ideally you should provide coffee and light fare for breakfast and beverages throughout the day (especially water). Food is surprisingly expensive though, so do what you can.

### What to buy

If you provide any food, you really _must_ supply vegetarian and dairy-free options because these dietary restrictions are very common. Going all-vegetarian isn’t a bad idea. After that, give consideration to other restrictions your participants may have (vegan, kosher, gluten-free) and do your best.

Be responsible with your food. Think like a parent. Order food that is relatively healthy. Avoid heavy foods that make people sleepy (like bread) or ineffective (like alcohol). Caffeine and sugar are fine (energy is important), but have real nourishment too..

### Budgeting and logistics

Figure on $7 to $15 per person. Pizza is the cheapest food to get, but it’s also basically the worst thing you can possibly feed someone (and not everyone eats it) — avoid pizza if you can.

If you are ordering food, you will probably place the order at least three days ahead of the event.
