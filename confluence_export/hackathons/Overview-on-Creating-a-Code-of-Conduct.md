Technology events have a history of not always being welcoming to women and minorities. We need to change that. You can be a part of that change by adopting a code of conduct for the event. A code of conduct is not just about enforcing rules. It sets community norms and sends a signal to would-be participants that you are trying to create a welcoming environment. And, of course, if there is a problem at your event having a code of conduct ahead of time will help you resolve the issue.

Look for codes of conduct used at events you admire, or copy from [Code for DC’s code of conduct](http://codefordc.org/resources/codeofconduct.html)or [Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day’s code of conduct](http://techladyhackathon.org/codeofconduct). Also read the [Hopper Conference Diversity Guide](http://conference.hopper.org.nz/#coc)’s section on this.
