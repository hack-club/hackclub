T-shirts are hugely popular event swag. They’re a walking advertisement for how much people love your event. However, they’re also really awful if not done well - poorly fitted shirts in inadequate size ranges exclude attendees.

Here’s some basics:

- Don’t just offer t-shirts. Offer a [sweet tote bag with your branding](https://twitter.com/ksuyin/status/760969571163512832) as an alternative.
- Offer men’s and women’s style shirts. Never do unisex ones. Unisex actually means men’s.
- Call them ‘straight fit’ and ‘curvy fit’, rather than ‘mens’ and ‘womens’ because not all men want men’s shirts and not all women want women’s shirts.
- Include a size guide, not just a list of sizes. This means chest measurements. Usually, your supplier will have these. Either link to theirs, or code up your own. Don’t skip it.
- Offer as wide a range of shirts as possible, even if it means working with 2 suppliers to extend the range into larger sizes. It is really hard to find women’s plus size tees, but [these people have some](http://www.wholesaletshirtsnz.com/category/ladies-womens-t-shirts-auckland).
- If you can’t offer a full range of sizes, include a ‘no-shirt’ option. No, women don’t want another men’s t-shirt as a nightie.
- Consider your print design. Women and men have different body shapes, and some designs are just plain bad when placed on a bust, including:
  - Anything with potential to be a double-entendre.
  - Wording that encourages people to stare closely at bust level.
  - Vertical lines that distort when placed over a larger bust.
  - Designs that sit too low so fall on underside of bust.

The Geek Feminism Wiki has a [really great in-depth article on this - check it out](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/T-shirts) (and send it to your designer).
