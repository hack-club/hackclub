# Registration Limit

Determine your maximum capacity. For an event with parallel tracks, bear in mind that participants will all gather in one room at the start of the event, so your maximum capacity is a little larger than the capacity of your main room (some people can squeeze/stand at the beginning).

For a free event, about 65% of those who register will actually show up. This number is very consistently seen across events. So cap registration at 150% of your actual maximum capacity.

# Gather info

Use the registration form to gather information about participants:

- Name (and possibly other information as required by venue security)
- Email address
- Job title
- Are they new to hackathons?
- What kind of hacker are they? Examples: Developer. Designer. Data Scientist. Domain Expert. Government Staff. Communicator. Project Manager. Advocate.
- What are they interested in hacking on? (free form question)
- Are they interested in any of the workshops?
- How they heard about the event
- Special needs/requests

The more information you can gather ahead of time the better planning you can do. You can start to think about who will be working on what as soon as registrations start coming. Literally try to imagine how each registered participant will keep occupied at the event based on whatever information you know about them.
