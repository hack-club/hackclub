# When you arrive early

- Make sure things are OK: tables/chairs are there, the projector works, restrooms are in working order
- Post signs from the main entrance of the building to where participants should go first
- Post signs to restrooms and any other rooms participants may need to go to
- Lay out the name badges. If they are printed with names, lay them out alphabetically and if there are a lot group them by part of the alphabet and post signs.

# Welcoming session

Start with a brief session welcoming everyone and laying out the day:

- Introduce the organizers
- Thank the venue and sponsors (do not forget anyone — _this_ is why they sponsored you)
- Explain the history and purpose of the event
- Mention the code of conduct (again, the point is often to set norms, not merely to enforce rules)
- Ask who has not been to a hackathon before, or to your particular event before; give an applause
- Explain logistics: the Tumblr, the schedule of workshops, lunch, end time
- Encourage people to take and share session notes and to record progress on projects (see the notes above on telling the hackathon’s story)

In a small event (up to about 30 people), you can have all of the participants introduce themselves.

Anyone who has brought a project to work on should then introduce the project to everyone. This is sometimes called “project pitches.” Keep each pitch short: the leader’s name and affiliation, a problem statement, the solution, and the skills/help needed. Project leaders tend to talk for as long as they can, so you may need to cut them off after one minute to be respectful of the audience’s time. Encourage leaders to think of this not as recruiting but as boasting how awesome their day is going to be.

# During the day

Have someone managing the hacking room. Go around to check that every project is going smoothly. See if anyone needs anything or can’t find something to work on. Keep people on the overall schedule. Alert everyone when it is time for lunch and one hour before the wrap-up session. Leading up to wrap-up, make sure each project is prepared to explain what they did. Get them to record their progress on the tumblr.

Have someone managing workshops. Make sure workshops stay on schedule, that participants are understanding the leader, can hear the leader from the back of the room, etc. Be around to ensure that the workshop leader doesn’t have any technology problems. An organizer should be on hand at the workshops at all times.

# Wrap-up

The wrap-up session gives everyone a chance to hear what everyone else worked on during the day. For a small group, ask volunteers to report what they accomplished or what they learned (especially for workshop participants). Give folks rounds of applause.

In large groups, have each project report on its accomplishments. If possible, let them show their work on the projector. But keep things quick. By this point projects may have a lot to say. Keep each project to 1 or 2 minutes, and if they are going to show something on the projector make sure it is ready before the wrap-up session begins.

Finally:

- Thank the venue and sponsors
- Thank the attendees and co-organizers
- If there is a post-event, direct people to it or ask a volunteer to lead people over

# Tear-down

Finally once all of the participants are gone, make sure the venue is returned to its original state:

- Clean up
- Remove signs
- Check for lost items
