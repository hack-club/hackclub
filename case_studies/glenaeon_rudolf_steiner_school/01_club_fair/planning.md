# Planning
At Glenaeon we do not have a club fair as such. However, in preparation for our
first meeting we have been reasonably engaged in creating interest by word of
mouth. One of the tactics we have been employing is talking to teachers and
finding out which students have shown interest in this kind of activity
previously. Although in order to create a more diverse environment we have also
been talking to more of the arts students.
