# Recap

1. Before the meeting started i decided to tell one of my co-leader to go buy a box of pasta and marshallow for our energizer.
2. Members came in and had them sign in at [signin.hackclubslhs.com](http://signin.hackclubslhs.com).
3. I introduced the new workshop, [soccer](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/workshops/soccer).
4. For the one that are still on [agar.io](http://agar.io) I introduced to them the [Ajar workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/workshops/contrib/ajar).
5. Half way throught the meeting I got everyone together and told them to build a tower using marshallow, pasta, and tape. The rule was The tower have to be touching the table, and marshallow is not allow to be touching anything except pasta.
6. Designs that members use are suprisingly similar to designs at Hack Camp ![marshallow on ceiling](http://i.imgur.com/Kexfo4M.jpg "marshallow on ceiling").
7. We will definitly do another energizer as members had lots of fun.
8. Continue workshop until 20 minute before the end of meeting, then I will tell them to submit a feedback at [feedback.hackclubslhs.com](http://feedback.hackclubslhs.com).

## What Didn't Go Well

- I forgotten to do the Hack Cheer.
- Forgotten to buy masking tape, so we sorta "took" some from the people thats putting up posters

## What Went Well

- The energizer got everyone doing something that doesnt involve members sitting on the computer, many of them wanted to do it again.
