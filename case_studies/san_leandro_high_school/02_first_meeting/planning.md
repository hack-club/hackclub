# Planning

### Plans for event
1. at the entrance we will wave our logo wildly to make sure members see us, as we are located in a less known part of school.
2. start off by giving the same speech given at [hack camp](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/blob/master/cohort_4/playbook/ACTIVITIES.md#introduction-talk)
3. give wifi password
4. fill out survey, so we can invite them to slack
5. send them on their way to create their own website with this [guide](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio) from hack camp.
6. do an activity where we can all get to know each other.
7. do the hack cheer!

### anticipated problems
* lack of directors to peer ratio, as 3/5 of our directors are doing sports the beginning 30min
* technical difficulty with the projector system
