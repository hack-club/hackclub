## What we end up doing

1. **We taped our logo to the door so members know which room we are in.**
2. **Started setup presentation however ran into problem with audio.**
3. Did a presentation using speech given at
   [hack camp](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio).
4. **Cut off half way during the speech as it is getting way too long**
5. Got everyone on a computer to start working on their own portfolio.
6. Ended with a activity where we say our name and a fact about me.
7. Ended the meeting with a hack cheer.
