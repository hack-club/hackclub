# Planning

## Plans for Event

1. One of our members wants to do a presentation to bring humor to the club.
2. Have everyone sign in through [google forms](http://signin.hacklcubslhs.com),
   also include survey.
3. Do a lecture on the basics of programming.
  - We had a debate on whether it is better to have a lecture or workshop, I
    stand on the workshop side. However everyone else is standing on having a
    lecture.
  - Attached below is the preparation done by the ones standing on doing it
    lecture style.

4. If members start to get bored, we will move on to one of the
   [workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio).
5. Give out a survey to see how members responded to having lectures during
   club, and other feedback.
6. End with Hack Cheer

## Anticipated problems

- Members may get bored from listening to me lecture
- Not a lot of members filling out survey at the end. Prevent this by having a
  dedicated time for members to fill out the survey.
