3. do a lecture on the basics of programming ![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/59a2f97fb73dce96a377ead9b595e10c.png "Lecture presentation preparation")
4. If members starts to get bored we will move on to one of the [workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio)
5. give out a survey to see how members responded to haveing lectures at club, and other feedback.
6. end with Hack Cheer

## Anticipated problems
* members may get bored from lisenting to me lecture
* not alot of members filling out survey at the end
  *prevent this by having a delicated time for members to fill out survey.
