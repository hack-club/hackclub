# Planning

## Plans for Event

1. one of our member wants to do an presentation to bring humor to the club
2. have everyone sign in through [google forms](signin.hacklcubslhs.com), also include survey
3. do a lecture on the basics of programming 
  * we had a debate on wether it is better to have a lecture or workshop, I stand on the worshop side, however everyone else is standing on having a lecture.
  * attatched below is the preparation done by the ones standing on doing it lecture style. ![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/59a2f97fb73dce96a377ead9b595e10c.png "Lecture presentation preparation")
4. If members starts to get bored we will move on to one of the [workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio)
5. give out a survey to see how members responded to having lectures at club, and other feedback.
6. end with Hack Cheer

## Anticipated problems
* members may get bored from listening to me lecture
* not a lot of members filling out survey at the end
  *prevent this by having a dedicated time for members to fill out survey.
