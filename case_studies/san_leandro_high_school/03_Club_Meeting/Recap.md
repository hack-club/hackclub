# Recap


1. lets just say this meeting started off as a disaster, our adviser is out and there is a sub, as you many know sub like to leave as soon as possible.
2. which then turns into our entire club waiting outside in the sun while some members and i run around school seeing if any teacher willing to give up their lab for 2 hour.
3. To my relief we found the bussiness academy teacher willing to give her lab to us for today. our original plan for today was to have a lecture on the basics of programming, however due to us not having access to the projectors, our plan change to doing the [portfolio worshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio). while doing the workshop I notice people are 
4. while doing the workshop I notie that:
  * some are on codecademy or codehs, which is totaly fine as they are allow to get off track if they want.

### What Didn't go well
* we dont have a back up plan if the original class room is not accessiable.

### what went well
* most of the members are willing to cooperate, which makes it really easy for me to work short handed easily

### tips for other organizers
* **Have a back up plan when the original meeting location is unavaliable**
