# Recap


1. lets just say this meeting started off as a disaster, our adviser is out and there is a substitute teaher, as you many know sub like to leave as soon as possible.
2. our entire club have to waiting outside in the sun while some members and I run around school seeing if any teacher willing to give up their lab for 2 hour.
3. To my relief we found the bussiness academy teacher willing to give her lab to us for today. our original plan for today was to have a lecture on the basics of programming, however due to us not having access to the projectors, our plan change to doing the [portfolio worshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio). while doing the workshop I notice people are 
4. while doing the workshop I notice that:
  * some are on codecademy or codehs, which is totaly fine as they are allow to get off track if they want.
    * most that are working on codecademy are helping each other out, however some time I have to jump in to help
    * when codehs people get stuck I will usually try to explain the problem to them in my own words.
  * some are asking for DDOS-ing tools or tips
    * I will usually respond to them that DDOS-ing is illegal, and that is not what this club is about.
      * if they really want to see DDOS-ing we can setup a controled envirment using raspberry pi.
    * people will usually help their friends thats sitting around them
      *maybe we can get encourage the entire club to work together by having group project instead. for example [neverforgetsam2k15.lol](neverforgetsam2k15.lol)
  * overall I would say that we need to find better team building activity to get the entire club engaged, something like [neverforgetsam2k15.lol](neverforgetsam2k15.lol)
5. as always we ended the Meeting with a [hack cheer](https://youtu.be/ds3w27_6i98)

### What Didn't go well
* we dont have a back up plan if the original class room is not accessible.

### what went well
* most of the members are willing to cooperate, which makes it really easy for me to work short handed easily

### tips for other organizers
* **Have a back up plan when the original meeting location is unavaliable**
