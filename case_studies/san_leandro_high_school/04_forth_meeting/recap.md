# Recap

1. As expected there is little members showing up at this meeting.
2. The low amount of members worked out well as it allowed me to have more personal chats with the members.
3. Most members want to make a game which Dodge is an attractive workshop for them.
4. Bring out a box of swags/goodies got everyone together, and talking. Most of them are talking about the Nfc tag we are handing out.
5. I decided to show off some Android development as a member asked for it. It seems that they try to connect the new things they learn to concepts that they have learned.

## What Didn't Go Well

- Alot of member didn't show up, we are thinging of sending email to remind them next week.

## What Went Well

- The way I didn't plan much for this meeting allow our schedule to be more flexible, people worked on different things, up to their liking.
