# Recap

1. This week we got ~10 members to come.
2. We are unable to get a sign in google for done, as we are having problem with
   url redirects.
3. I started people off by having them do
   [Dodge](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/workshops/dodge).
    4. Some members are playing [Agario](https://agar.io), possible that they
   are getting borded, maybe we should give them challenges.
5. The feedback was a disaster, we tried to get the url redirect fixed in time
   for feedback, however while we are scrambling to get that fixed, we didn't
   realize that we are redireting to the wrong URL.

## What Didn't Go Well

- We didn't get the google form sign in ready in time, and url redirect is
  having problem.
- While we are trying to fix the url redirect problem, we somehow messed with
  the feedback url redirect also, causing it to redirect to the wrong link.
