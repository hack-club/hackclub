# Planning

## Plans for Event

this meeting I have decided to make a more freedom plan, so members can go on
their own direction.

1. I will ask members what they want to do, twilio, or dodge.
2. I will then go arond answering any question members have. Half way
   through the meeting I will bring nfc tags, stickers, and digital ocean promo
   codes for give away.

## Anticipated Problems

- not clear enought planning.
- low number of members showing up as, there was no meeting last week.
