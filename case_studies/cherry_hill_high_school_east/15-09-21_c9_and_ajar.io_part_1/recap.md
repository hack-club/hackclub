# Recap  â€“ *Monday, September 21st, 2015*

Another successful meeting for the Cherry Hill Computer Science Club! Had around 30 people attend, with 3 or 4 new members, even though there were no "late busses" (second round of busses at 4pm).

The club officers met during the weekend to talk about the club and create content. We made:

- [Google Slide presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12EV5p5hZW1vRDzhjUGbSsconuaTV2mTil9-1FlEoPn8)
- 

## Cloud9 intro

We decided it was time to transition off of JS 

> ## On the teaching side

> - Getting more comfortable teaching: speaking louder, explaining more clearly.
- Fewer distractions, more focused on answering questions. I was constantly circling the room (the room is essentially circular).
- Better at getting people's attention (turning lights on and off, speaking louder, getting VPs to help gather people's attention).
