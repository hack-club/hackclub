Elizabeth High School - Amy Sorto - 10/27 Attendance: 25

Main issues are the school wifi, blocking things such as making github
accounts or stack overflow.

They wanted the cs club's help to make a website for bilingual students in our
city.

Runs a newsletter for her club.

The club is mainly sophomore/juniors now so we are set.

"Last meeting we had elections for some positions, and then did some live
coding on making a website. Also, our attendance went up from the last
meeting! We have 25 members now!"
