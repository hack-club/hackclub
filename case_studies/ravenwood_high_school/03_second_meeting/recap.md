# Recap

We had a total of 13 members show up to the 2nd meeting for our programming
club. This is definitely progress since it's over twice the size of our first
meeting. Most of the members were interested in EasyCTF. We're likely going to
have two teams from RHS participate in it. The CTF is specifically for HS'ers
and ranges from quite basic to difficult problems so I think it'll be a good
learning experience for even those who aren't experienced in programming,
but we'll have to see.
