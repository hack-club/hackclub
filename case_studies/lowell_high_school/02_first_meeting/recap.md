# Recap

Well the first meeting did not go the best. We ran into a few crucial issues,
the biggest being we had to change rooms at the last minute, so even though we
left a note on the door of the original room, Im sure many people were dissuaded
or were too lazy to find the new room.

The presentation and the Wand demonstration went fairly smoothly, the only issue
being some people could not get the page to play any sound for the Wand demo.
The majority of the ~15 attendees had not coded before, so there will be lots to
teach. Hopefully attendence will increase a little bit more when we get in touch
with Girls Who Code and recruit some of their members to join our club, and when
we get up all of our posters.
