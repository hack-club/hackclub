# Recap

This week had an overall better atmosphere than last week's meeting.

This week we tried using PowerPoint Slides to make announcements, and
it seemed to grab the overall attention of the room better than just
vocal announcements.

A solid 10 people showed up again (I feel this is going to continue for
the rest of the semester).

We tried out doing Dodge and Soccer this week, gaining overall better
workshop feedback, however, I failed to check to see if anything was
blocked by the school, and sure enough, Imgur was blocked. This
caused some disappointment with our members but was easily made up with
the soccer workshop. Also http://tlk.io was down that day so there was struggles
with links, but luckily Dave gave us shorter links for the ease of the members.

Right now I'm seeing the freshman open up better to one another and am starting
to see a community to form- a community that can laugh and goof around together.

Right now, the only personal improvements we could make are checking the sites
in advance so that embarrassments like during that meeting would not occur
