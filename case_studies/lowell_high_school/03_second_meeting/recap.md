# Recap

Overall the meeting went well! We did not do the ice breaker game, because so
many people were coming in late or straggling, but this time we had more
attendees, around 12 I believe. The majority of them seemed to like the
workshop, which was awesome. Many finished building their portfolio webpage in
about 30-45 minutes.

Getting the attendees to talk was one of my primary concerns, but once I talked
to them about how important asking questions is, and how you should rely on the
people sitting next to you and the internet for help, many seemed to want to
help each other when they finished, or they worked together to figure out a
problem.

Going forward, we are still trying to recruit more people. 12 is a solid amount,
but I doubt all 12 will show up each week. We are trying to put up more posters
to get our name out there.
