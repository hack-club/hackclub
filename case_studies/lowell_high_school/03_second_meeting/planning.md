# Planning

For this meeting, we decided to do the
[Portfolio workshop](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/playbook/workshops/portfolio).
We also wanted to do a ice breaker game, and Jonathan suggested we try "The Big
Wind Blows", so we will try to play that.

I anticipate that we are going to have problems getting people to start talking
to each other. Since we are expecting so few students, I doubt there will be
lots of conversation.
