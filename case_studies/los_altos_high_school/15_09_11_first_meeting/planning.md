#Planning

An outline of what's going to happen at the event
A list of problems that you anticipate you might run into and how you might solve them
Any other associated planning done to make that event great.

## Outline

- Go over what this club is really about, and introduce everyone
- Redefine hacking in terms of the positive connotation
- We had issues with emailing, so planning wasn't too good in terms of
  member recruitment
- Created a presentation in order to put all intro information together in order
  to give an easy reference to club members
