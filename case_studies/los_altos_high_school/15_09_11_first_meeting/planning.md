# Planning

## Outline

- Go over what this club is really about and introduce everyone.
- Redefine hacking in terms of the positive connotation.

## Problems

- We had issues with emailing so planning wasn't too good in terms of member
  recruitment.

## Other Miscellaneous Planning

- Create a presentation in order to put all intro information together in order
  to give an easy reference to club members.
