# 5th Meeting

## What Happened

- We went through the presentation.
- We went through a for loop example at the end.

```
for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  if(i % 2 == 0) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

## Problems we faced

- A hacker asked about why we wouldn't use javascript as opposed to full CSS.
  - We had a hard time explaining with no real research on it.
  - It might have confused some other hackers not very familiar with javascript
    or browser compatibility.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- We tried explaining why CSS would be better with some educated guess, and
  made sure everyone understood the question.

## Tips

- Be ready for questions that might be relatable for the future. Such as why CSS
  instead of Javascript.
