# San Mateo Programming Club

Welcome to San Mateo's Programming Club case studies! We have a
[Github Repository](https://github.com/SMHS-Programming/club/tree/70c64404331b85369d098da277f473424a14273b)
where we keep all of our progress and works. Similar to hackEDU's hackCamp.

## Meetings

We meet on Mondays and Wednesdays during lunch time, roughly 25 minutes to work
on workshops, project time and demos. We work on 5 week cycles:

- Week 1 & 2 are dedicated to Workshops and Learning.
- Week 3 & 4 are for hackers to work on projects with their partners
- Week 5 is Demo Week, everyone ships their projects and demos them to the
  rest of the hackers.

## Plans for the future

We plan to attend a lot of hackathons, for example hackingEDU, and we hope to
be able to have field trips with girlsWhoCode club and organize hackathons with
them.
