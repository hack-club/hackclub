  people.

## Problems we faced

- The VGA cable is "strange" with an extra piece of metal which makes it not
  fit to the adapter.
  - We ended up transferring the presentation to the teacher's computer and
    present from there.
  - The internet had gone down the second I started uploading, we needed to use
    a usb stick.
  - Presentation delayed 1 min.
- A lot of hackers came in, a total of 38 people came in a room for 30. Some
  people needed to stand in the back.

  for first time demo.
- We **ended up with extra time**
