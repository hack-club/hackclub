# 16th Meeting

## What Happened

- A teacher did not allow us into the computer lab until our advisor came.
- Previously our advisor would give us the keys and we would just start the
  meet.
- We went looking for our advisor ~10 minutes was wasted.
- No other leaders came, only 1 did.
- We enter the room and start going through the slides.
- 10 people showed up!
- We passed field trip forms and started projects.

## Problems we faced

- Only 1 leader came for 10 members.
- Dealt with teacher who didn't let us in at first and made us waste 10 minutes.
- Hackers didn't seem to know what to build.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- Talked to all leaders and let them know I (Sam) wasn't happy about lack of
  leaders.
- Talked to advisor and got it arranged.
- Tried encouraging them to find ideas.

## Tips

- I guess always make sure when your leaders are coming. It shouldn't happen,
  but make sure to tell your other leaders that they **must** notify you when
  they do not come.
- Going around, talk to the Hackers constantly and ask questions, this will help
  with future contact and meets.
