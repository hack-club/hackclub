- Speech was cancelled.
- Hacking started! We thought of ideas, a lot of them and started programming.
- Most of the hackers started learning through codeacademy or any learning
  websites and then we started working on our project.
- We thought of an idea that allows you find people in a hackathon and then
  be able to contact them easily.
