# Club Fair Recap

## What Happened

- We setted up, chose one of the best tables.
- We ended up sharing tables with Interactive Coding Club because there wasn't
  much space for them.
- We had a very big poster:

- It was very windy, so the poster kept on falling off.
- One of the leaders at the end could come, so we were 3 at the table.
- We ended up not flying the drone.
- We had 18 people sign up.

## Problems we faced

- The windy environment was a problem, as we needed to hold the papers tight.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- For the poster, we had 2 people hold the poster up right.

## Tips

- Having a Big Poster I think influenced a lot of people to come by and check
  it out.
- If you do share a table, make sure to keep organized.
- Make sure to have in your poster the most cool stuff and familiar logos that
  will attract people.
- Talk to people as they come by, say Hi to everyone, some of them will come
  and visit.
- Talk about what you will be doing during the school year briefly, and then
  talk about very exciting project people seemed interested in such as
  hackathons.
- Don't expect _anybody_ to know about programming.
- Shoutouts is a great way to advertise your club, make sure to not get
  distracted by it when they do so. In our school, we had speakers with music
  and the leadership team mentioning clubs. If you have something similar, use
  it to your advantage. If you don't have it, request it has it's very useful
  and sets up the mood.
