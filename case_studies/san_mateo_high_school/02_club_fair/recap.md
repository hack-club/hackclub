# Club Fair Recap

## What Happened

- We setted up, chose one of the best tables.
- We ended up sharing tables with Interactive Coding Club because there wasn't
  much space for them.
- We had a very big poster:

- It was very windy, so the poster kept on falling off.
- We had some friends and a leader hold the poster.
- One of the leaders at the end could come, so we were 3 at the table.
- We ended up not flying the drone.
- We had 18 people sign up.

## Problems we faced

- The windy environment was a problem, as we needed to hold the papers tight.

## Tips

- Having a Big Poster I think influenced a lot of people to come by and check
  it out.
- If you do share a table, make sure to keep organized.
- Make sure to have in your poster the most cool stuff and familiar logos that
  will attract people.
- Talk to people as they come by, say Hi to everyone, some of them will come
  and visit.
- Talk about what you will be doing during the school year briefly, and then
  talk about very exciting project people seemed interested in such as
  hackathons.
- Don't expect _anybody_ to know about programming.
- Shoutouts is a great way to advertise your club, make sure to not get
  distracted by it when they do so.
