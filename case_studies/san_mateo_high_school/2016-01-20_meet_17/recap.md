# 17th Meeting

## What Happened

- We met Megan and she came in into our room.
- Had 2 original hackers from regular club meetings.
- Due to lack of hackers, we needed to go with Plan B - demo leader product.
- As leader was presenting, other students came in, but not regular club
  members.
- Made it difficult for the leader presenting as the students that came hadn't
  done the previous workshops.
- We had a hacker present their project at the end.
- Ended up with just a small talk with Megan and had everyone collect Swag at
  the end.

## Problems we faced

- Very low attendance from original club hackers.
- There weren't any projects ready.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- We went with Plan B, which didn't work out too well.
- We need to find a way to encourage more projects.

## Tips

- Insure attendance and plans for Demos and when there is a visitor.
