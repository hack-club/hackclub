- Passed small sheets of paper for feedback of demos.
- 3 hackers presented their works.
- Talked about Los Altos Hacks.
- Briefly talk about club picture happening on Tuesday.

## Problems we faced

- Very few hackers presented.
- We had leftover time and didn't have a plan for it.

## How we managed problems and outcomes

- We tried encouraging more people to present, gave out stickers to anyone
  presenting.
- We went to [www.getwiththe.club](http://www.getwiththe.club) -- it didn't work
  very well and the website wasn't too complete.

## Tips

- Have Plan B or extra time activity as backup to make sure you keep everyone
  entertained.
- Make sure you make it clear why Demoing is important and why everyone should
  be encouraged to do so.
- Also explain the purpose of the feedback forms.
