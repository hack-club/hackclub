## What is a Hack Club?

We think of Hack Clubs very broadly:

- Hacking is creative problem solving (it doesn't have to be about technology)
- A Hack Club is an after-school high school club where place where people come
  together to hack

Most Hack Clubs end up looking like never-ending hackathons, where club members
come together twice a week (generally for ~1.5 hours) and work on projects
together. To start out, we have a series of 1 hour workshops (in the
[`workshops/`](../workshops/) directory) to get members started. More on how
workshops work in [_The First Meeting_](#the-first-meeting).

Throughout the school year, Hack Clubs go to (and sometimes host) hackathons,
work on larger group projects, and---most importantly---build a thriving community
of hackers at their high schools.

In the below sections we'll walk you through the process of setting up your Hack
Club and running your first few meetings. After you've gotten the first two
meetings down, you should be set for the remainder of the school year :smile:.

## Planning your Hack Club

You should plan on starting this process two to three weeks before having your
first meeting. Fortunately there isn't an enormous amount of planning needed to
start a club, but it's very important to get each of the following right.

- [ ] Leadership team
- [ ] Teacher sponsor and space
- [ ] Club registration
- [ ] 50 student sign-ups for the first meeting

_(each of the below sections corresponds with a bullet point)_

### Leadership Team

You'll want 2-3 people on the primary leadership team running the club. When
choosing your leadership team, we recommend working with close friends who you
think have strong leadership skills. It's also a good idea to have a mix of
genders on the leadership team. Correlation doesn't imply causation, but the
club member demographics mirror the demographics of the leadership team in many
clubs.

Also, leadership skills are _far_ more important than technical skills. A common
pitfall many clubs run into is selecting the leaders based on their technical
skills rather than their leadership capacity.

**Great clubs have been started by leaders that have never coded before.**

When putting together the leadership team, make sure to choose one leader who's
"in charge" (this will generally be you). This will be the person that has the
final authority to make changes in the club.

A common pitfall is to create a democratic selection process where everyone has
an equal vote on decisions. This doesn't work because it's easy for less-active
leaders to override decisions of the club president -- the best system is one
where leaders get a say proportional to their investment in the club (and the
easiest way to implement this is to have a fair leader).

### Teacher sponsor and space

A good teacher sponsor is your key to having access to regular space for club
meetings and a good relationship with your school. Your teacher sponsor is the
person who will regularly lend a classroom to you after-school for meetings. And
when things go wrong with the school administration, your teacher sponsor will
be your advocate. Choosing the wrong teacher sponsor has been the fatal to
clubs, so be wary.

The best teacher sponsors are personally invested in spreading coding to
students. If your school started a computer science class (or another class, if
it already has one), think about which teachers would volunteer to teach it.
Those are the teachers you want as your sponsor. If you're new to your school
and not very familiar with the teachers, you'll generally want to look into the
math and science teachers. If your school has a computer lab, start with the
teachers that teach classes in it (or if your school has classrooms with
computers in it, start with teachers with computer classrooms).

Once you've decided on a few potential teacher sponsors, it's time to reach out
to them and tell them about your idea to start a Hack Club. The best way to do
this is to come to their classroom right after school ends (or during lunch) and
talk to them in person. If you don't already know the teacher, introduce
yourself, say that you're thinking about starting this thing called a Hack Club
and you're looking for a teacher sponsor, then explain the club to them. Here's
an example of what you might want to start off by saying:

> Hi Ms. Byrd, I'm Zach. I'm currently a freshman and I'm starting a Hack Club
> at ESHS. It's essentially a computer coding club where students meet regularly
> to build things like apps, websites, and games together (and learn!). I've put
> together a leadership team and I'm currently looking for a teacher sponsor for
> the club. I figured I'd reach out because I heard you ran the Hour of Code in
> your classroom in December.

You'll want to get your teacher sponsor to commit to providing a space
after-school twice a week for 1.5 hours (ideally 2 hours so there's extra time
if members want to stay after meetings).

The difficulty of getting a teacher sponsor varies widely school to school. At
some schools you'll find a good teacher sponsor on your first try and at others
it'll take talking to 5-6 teachers. The most important thing is to not give up
and to be persistent.

### Club registration

Most high schools require you to register your club with the student council or
school administration before having your first meeting.

Generally they have an application to fill out
([click here][lowell_club_application] for an example). Some schools require
having a club constitution that outlines the club's purpose and operational
procedures. We recommend asking for a template constitution from the school
(most have them) and just filling it out -- the constitution won't have too much
impact on your day-to-day operations.

This shouldn't take very long, especially once you have a teacher sponsor to
back you.

### Student Sign-ups

Alright. Now for the most important part of this whole process: actually getting
people to come to your club.

Most schools have a day for advertising clubs at the beginning of each semester.
This commonly called the "club fair", "club day", "club rush", or "club
showcase". It is _extremely important_ that you have a presence at this event --
this is your opportunity to get the most important members---freshman and
sophomores---to your first club meeting.

The best way to take advantage of your school's "club day" (or equivalent) is to
bring food and be _super proactive_ about getting people to give you their name,
email, and phone numbers. It's boring, but a pencil and a clipboard with a list
of people's info is often the best way to collect this information (though feel
free to experiment).

If you want to have 20 to 30 members come to your first meeting, you should
shoot for at least 50 sign-ups. If you want 50 to come, shoot for at least 80.
You should expect 25% of the members at the first meeting and second meeting to
not come back to the third. Members who come to the third meeting tend to
continue to come to the club throughout the year. Adjust your sign-ups target
according to how many people you want to come to the club regularly.

## The First Meeting

The first two meetings of each semester are the most important you'll ever have
-- they determine who comes back to the club.

You should expect 25% of the members at the first two meetings to not come back
to the third. The members who come to the third meeting tend to stay for the
rest of the year, so your primary goal for this meeting is to get members to
come back to the second meeting (and later, the third).

For the first meeting, you'll want to share what your Hack Club will be doing
throughout the year and have them build their _first real thingâ„¢_ (a personal
website), using our [Portfolio](../workshops/portfolio/README.md) workshop.
After they complete the workshop, they'll have the remainder of the meeting to
keep building their website to make it unique. At the second meeting, you'll
pick up where you left off and build up to demos, where everyone from the club
will come to the front and demo what they built at the end of the meeting.

A small, but easy way to dramatically improve your first meeting is to bring
food. Pastries or cookies from a local supermarket are cheap and work well.

We recommend the following format for your first meeting:

1. Wait for hackers (club members) to arrive (5 minutes)
2. Introduction presentation (5 minutes)
3. Learning names activity (10 minutes)
4. Build your first website workshop (45 minutes)
5. Free-form hacking (25 minutes)
6. Reminder with details for second meeting

## The Second Meeting

The second meeting will pick up where the first meeting left off. The majority
of the meeting will be free-form time where hackers will continue expanding on
their portfolio websites. At the end of the meeting, everyone will come up to
the front of the space and demo their website. Like the first meeting, bringing
food is a good idea :wink:.

Here's our suggested schedule:

1. Wait for hackers to arrive (5 minutes)
2. Announcements (5 minutes)
3. Free-form hacking (45 minutes)
4. Demos (20 minutes)
