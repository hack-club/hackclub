# Application FAQ

### How long will the application take?

Filling out your application should take around 45 minutes to an hour and the leader profiles should take about 30 minutes each.

### Do I need anything to fill out the application?

[You should already have a team](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/master/clubs/leadership_preface.md). While we encourage you to have a committed teacher sponsor before applying, we don't require it.

### What should my YouTube video be about?

[This link](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/master/clubs/youtube_video.md) covers it.

### We already have our own club. Why should we apply?

Many of our applicants are from clubs that have already been holding meetings, sometimes for years. We provide resources and a community you won't get anywhere else.

### Once I submit my application, how long will it be until I start the club?

After submitting your application, we'll get back to you in 1-3 days to accept or reject it.

As long as you follow each of the steps in the application process, and we decide to accept you into our program, you should be ready to hold your first meeting within 2 weeks.

### What is the acceptance/rejection rate?

We don't publish our acceptance/rejection rate. We receive hundreds of applications from people asking us to "hack Facebook" and other forms of spam, so it's not a good indicator what your chances are of getting in.

To be perfectly honest, if you apply with detailed responses and show that you've started organizing your club, we'll probably accept you.

The application is a tool to get you thinking about your club and for us to get an understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.

### What happens after I submit my application?

You should get a confirmation email at the address you logged in with to confirm your application reached us.

In 1-3 days we'll get back to you over email or text and let you know if you've been accepted or rejected. If you haven't heard anything from us after 3 days, [contact us](#how-do-i-ask-you-a-question).

### What happens if I'm accepted?

We'll schedule an onboarding call with you. During the call we'll get to know each other and plan out the club.

# Club FAQ

### How much does this cost?

\$0. Null. Nothing. Nada.

Our entire program is 100% free.

### How many hours should I expect to put into this?

Every club is different. On average though, clubs break down into 2 categories:

1. before the first meeting, most leaders commit around 7-10 hours per week marketing and planning to launch
2. a few meetings in, once members can show up without a weekly reminder, most leaders commit around 4-5 hours per week

### How do I ask you a question?
