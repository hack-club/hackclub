Notes on your leadership team:

To put it straight, your leadership team is the most important part of your club. Clubs are nothing more than the people they consist of and, as a result, the people doing the organizing determine whether you succeed or die.

We strongly recommend having a leadership team of 2-3 co-founders. This [article](http://www.paulgraham.com/founders.html) has a good overview of general good practices when picking co-founders (it's written for people starting companies, but applies to Hack Clubs).

On top of that, we have a few recommendations specifically for Hack Club co-founders:

- **Not everyone needs to be technical**
  - There will be a ton of non-technical work. One of Reddit's two co-founders didn't know how to program.
- **Your team should have an equal gender ratio**
  - Diversity in tech sucks. At nearly every Hack Club, the demographics of the members matches the demographics of the leaders â€“ having an equal gender ratio on the leadership team is the most effective method we've found for making sure Hack Clubs are inclusive to all.
- **You want at least one super technical co-founder**
  - No explanation needed
- **You want at least one super charismatic co-founder**
  - The quality of your club doesn't matter if nobody shows up. You need at least one co-founder that's extremely charismatic and can get people excited about what you're doing.

Once you've put together your team, send me everyone's names and emails so I can make sure to include them in our communication going forward.
