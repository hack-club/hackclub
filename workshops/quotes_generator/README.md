# Quotes Generator

In this workshop, we'll be building a random quotes generator using an API in React. By the end of it, you'll have learned about handling APIs in React, as well as some cool concepts like React Hooks!

[![Quotes Generator](https://cloud-fl1p1zjes.vercel.app/0image.png)](https://rzfit.csb.app/)

Here's the [source code](https://codesandbox.io/s/random-quotes-generator-rzfit).

## Part 1: Prerequisites

You should know some basics of React and I recommend you to follow [this](https://workshops.hackclub.com/nextjs_starter/) workshop before proceeding further. If you're having trouble, feel free to ask [me](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/user_profile/U014ND5P1N2) or anyone in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/)!

## Part 2: Setup

For writing our code, we'll be using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) which turns out to be the best online code editor for React.

To get started, go to this [starter code](https://codesandbox.io/s/quotesgeneratorstartercode-29ffd). Press **`ctrl+s`** / **`cmd+s`** and it will automatically fork it for you. Now, we have everything set up so let's get started!

## Part 3: Building the project

### 1) Inspecting the starter code

Let's first have a look at our project's starter code.

![image of directories in our project](https://cloud-9ne6wtuvp.vercel.app/0image.png)

First, there are 2 main directories and a `package.json` file. We'll ignore the `package.json` file for now and let's have a look at the 2 directories, namely, `public/` and `src/`.

Usually, the `public/` directory contains an HTML file and all your assets. We won't be touching the `public/` directory during the whole workshop, not even the HTML file!

Next is the `src/` directory which contains all your JavaScript files and your CSS files. We have an `index.js` file, which basically renders our React code. The `style.css` file is already written for you.

Next is the `App.js` file. Now basically, when we build big projects, we don't start directly with the `App.js` file. We create small components and then add them together in the `App` component. But today, we'll be building a quotes generator, which turns out to be pretty small and easy. So, we'll start writing our code directly in the `App` component to avoid making unnecessary components.

This is what our `App.js` file looks right now.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p>Hello World</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This code simply renders out `Hello World` on your browser.

Now we know where we are with our code, so it's time to start!

### 2) The UI

First let's build the basic UI of how our website should look like. Write the following code in the `App` component's `return()`.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1 className="title">Quotes Generator</h1>
      <p className="quotes">This is a quote</p>
      <p className="author">- author name</p>
      <button className="button">New Quote</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We built a very basic UI for our project and everything is self-explanatory here. The `button` doesn't right now and also we haven't yet made any `API calls`. So let's start adding the main functionality.

This is what your preview window should look like:

![Preview window](https://cloud-1ugc07d1z.vercel.app/0image.png)

### 3) API Call

Basically, we'll be making an API request to a url which will return us a json of quotes and their authors. Then we'll store this data in a state using the `useState` hook so we can re-render our component whenever it changes.

![useState's epic picture](https://cloud-90fxjk0al.vercel.app/0image.png)

The url where we will make the request is `https://type.fit/api/quotes`. If you open this link in the browser, you'll see a json file full of quotes!

![What you see in the browser](https://cloud-h7wzq13xb.vercel.app/0image.png)

Let's start working with it.

Inside the `App.js`, first we'll create a new variable to store this url, next we'll create an empty state to store the data.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"; //<-- Import useState
import "./styles.css";

const url = "https://type.fit/api/quotes"; // The API URL

export default function App() {
  const [quotes, setQuotes] = useState({}); // Creating a state

  // Returning all the jsx we wrote below this line.
  return (...)
}
```

Explanation: We create a `url` variable using `const` so its value never changes again and assign it to the API's URL. Then we'll import `useState` from `react` and using the basic boilerplate code, we create a `quotes` state. It is currently assigned to an empty object, but will be replaced soon!

Now let's write a function which will make the API request and fetch the data from that URL. We'll use `async functions` because it will return us a promise. We'll also use `await` inside the `async function`.

![Image of async await which looks cool](https://cloud-b58j7jpbu.vercel.app/0image.png)

The `await` operator is used to wait for a `Promise` to either resolve or reject. It can only be used inside an `async function`.

`Async functions` can contain zero or more `await` expressions. `Await` expressions suspend progress through an `async function`, yielding control and subsequently resuming progress only when an awaited promise-based asynchronous operation is either fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression. Use of `async` / `await` enables the use of ordinary `try` / `catch` blocks around asynchronous code.

Learn more about [`Async await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await).

Inside our `App` component, we'll create an `async` function `getQuotes()` and now let's start fetching the data.

```jsx
async function getQuotes() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    const data = await res.json();
    setQuotes(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
```

Explanation: Inside our `async` function, we add a `try` / `catch` block, which will help us to get the data or throw errors if not successful. We create a variable called `res` (shortform for `response`) which will store the response we get after we fetch the data from the URL. Now this response is not yet ready to use and we need to convert it to `json()` format before using it. So we store that json formatted data in the `data` variable. And lastly, we store all the data inside our `quotes` state using `setQuotes`.

The `catch` block will simply catch an error (if any) and then log it to the console.

![try catch example](https://cloud-oxjmrq4w2.vercel.app/0image.png)

Our `async` function is complete and we can now use the data we got from the API request.

Now if we take a look at the value stored inside our state, we'll notice that it is a whole big array consisting of 100s of objects containing quotes! 

![Image of the state containing 1000s of quotes](https://cloud-7drh3ecj9.vercel.app/0image.png)

**NOTE:** You can check this in the codeSandbox's `React DevTools` (next to the console).

We only need to display 1 random quote at a time. So, for this, we only need to store a single random object from that array inside our state.

Using the formula for getting a random number, let's create a function outside our component which will return us a random number.

```jsx
// ...

const randomNo = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * data.length) + 1;

export default function App() {
  // code from earlier workshop
}
```

Now this function will always return a random number between 1 and `data.length` (the length of the `data` array).

The browser must be yelling at you that `data` is undefined. It is because we have defined it later inside our component. So, a quick fix for this will be to create a `data` variable using `let` above our `randomNo()` function and remove the `const` keyword from the `data` inside the async function.

What we basically did is that we already defined `data` but we'll pass the value to it later inside the `async function`.

Now we have a random number generated everytime the `randomNo()` function is called. And if we pass it to an array, it will return us the value on that index. So, inside the async function, when we set the state, we'll add square brackets to `data` and call `randomNo()` in it.

```jsx
setQuotes(data[randomNo()]);
```

This will return us the object which is on the index of the `randomNo()`.

Now only one random object containing the quote and the author will be stored inside the `quotes` state.

<details><summary>Your code so far:</summary>

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./styles.css";

const url = "https://type.fit/api/quotes";
let data;
const randomNo = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * data.length) + 1;

export default function App() {
  const [quotes, setQuotes] = useState({});

  async function getQuotes() {
    try {
      const res = await fetch(url);
      data = await res.json();
      setQuotes(data[randomNo()]);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1 className="title">Quotes Generator</h1>
      <p className="quotes">This is a quote</p>
      <p className="author">- author name</p>
      <button className="button">New Quote</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</details>

The next thing we want to implement is that we want to get a random quote everytime our website is loaded. This can easily be done by creating a  `useEffect` hook inside our component, calling our `getQuotes()` function in it and passing an empty dependency array to it.

![useEffect's photo](https://cloud-q749otmin.vercel.app/0image.png)

**Note:** Make sure you import `useEffect` from `react`.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
```

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [quotes, setQuotes] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    getQuotes();
  }, []);
  // Rest of the code
```

Learn more about the [`useEffect`](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/react-hooks-how-to-use-useeffect-ecea3e90d84f) hook.


We can now edit our jsx code to display the quote and the author name.

```jsx
return (
  <div className="App">
    <h1 className="title">Quotes Generator</h1>
    <p className="quotes">{quotes.text}</p>
    <p className="author">- {quotes.author ? quotes.author : "Anonymous"}</p>
    <button className="button">New Quote</button>
  </div>
);
```

Explanation: The quote (which is in the object as `text`) is now rendered on the page. Notice how I used a [`ternary operator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to render the author name. It is because, there are some quotes which don't have an author, so we check if there's an author inside our object. If it's there, we render the name of the author. If its not there, we render `Anonymous` on the browser screen.

Now if you look at the preview window, you'll see that we are pretty much done! The last thing remaining is to add an `onClick` to our button.

```jsx
<button className="button" onClick={getQuotes}>New Quote</button>
```

Whenever the button will be clicked, the `getQuotes()` function will be called which will return a new random quote, resulting into a state change which will cause our component to re-render!

Woah! You just wrote some mind blowing code!

<details><summary>The Final Code:</summary>

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import "./styles.css";

const url = "https://type.fit/api/quotes";
let data;
const randomNo = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * data.length) + 1;

export default function App() {
  const [quotes, setQuotes] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    getQuotes();
  }, []);

  async function getQuotes() {
    try {
      const res = await fetch(url);
      data = await res.json();
      setQuotes(data[randomNo()]);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1 className="title">Quotes Generator</h1>
      <p className="quotes">{quotes.text}</p>
      <p className="author">- {quotes.author ? quotes.author : "Anonymous"}</p>
      <button className="button" onClick={getQuotes}>
        New Quote
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
