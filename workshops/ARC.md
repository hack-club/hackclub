# Workshops Arc

This document outlines our curriculum arc. In many ways, this is the syllabus
for Hack Club.

Hack Clubs are after-school high school clubs where people build things
together. They can almost be thought of as never-ending hackathons, where club
members come together twice a week (generally for ~1.5 hours) and work on
projects together. Throughout the school year, Hack Clubs go (and sometimes
host) hackathons, work on larger group projects, and---most importantly---build
a thriving community of hackers at their high schools.

While the goal with Hack Clubs is for most meetings to be free-form time where
hackers are working on projects together, we're actively developing a series of
open-source workshops to bring members from no experience to the point where
they can hack on projects.

Hackers use the following tools for workshops:

- [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) - development environment
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - code host
  - All Hack Club development goes into a
    [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repository called
    `[username].github.io` (replacing `[username]` with their GitHub username)
  - Each project done in Hack Club (so at least each workshop) goes into a
    sub-directory called `project_name` in the main `[username].github.io`
    project. The hackers should be regularly committing and pushing. For
    example, if I were doing the Portfolio workshop, I'd put my work in
    `[username].github.io/portfolio/`.

Below is the initial plan for the Hack Club workshop progression. The `Week #`
column is the week since the club's first meeting that the concept and workshop
should be run. `Meeting #` is the meeting that it should be run in. It assumes
that meetings happen twice a week and that every other meeting is free-form time
for hacking.

## Concept Arc

By following the Hack Club workshops, you should be learning the following
concepts in the order they are listed below. Note that many concepts can be
moved several or more slots higher or lower.

- pair programming
- HTML - tags - writing of
- HTML - tags - go in order
- class & id
- HTML - tags - nesting
- HTML - box model
- HTML - bootstrap
- basic types
  - strings
  - numbers
  - true / false
  - arrays
- functions - usage - with inputs
- code runs in order
- basic operations as syntactic sugar
  - numerical operations
  - string concatenation
- abstraction
- variables - remembering basic types
- string concatenation with variables
- variables - remembering outputs of functions
- functions usage - outputs
- functions usage - with outputs vs side effects
- function usage - no inputs
