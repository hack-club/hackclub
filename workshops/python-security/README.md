# Python Security
In this workshop, we will be creating a secure python password saving system.
Final Code: https://repl.it/@nt998302/CalculatingSeveralData#ansi_codes.txt

## Getting Setup
To start, we will have to create a fresh **python** project in repl.it. You can name this anything  you want.
Once your project has been created, go directly to the **main.py** file. This is where we will be doing all our work. In this file, let's import the hashlib module from the built-in python library. This will allow us to hash and salt our passwords using a popular method called 'sha256'.
