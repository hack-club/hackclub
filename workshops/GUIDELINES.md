# Guidelines

This is a set of guidelines to help you make your workshops great!

## Start With the Result of a Workshop

Show what you’re building before you build it. You could show a screenshot of
the code and graphical outcome (if applicable), but even better is a live demo
of the code working.  If you don’t show the result first, people might not find
the concepts relevant, which may cause them to lose focus.

## Break the Workshop into Steps

Break up the workshop into manageable steps. Each step should add one feature
to the project, no more. Steps help keep content organized. Limit the number of
new concepts introduced in each step, ideally one, no more than two. If you
introduce too many concepts in a step, people can quickly be overwhelmed, a
concept should be introduced, implemented and then built upon.

## Write in second steps

Using the word "you" versus "we" establishes more familiarity with the reader.
It also helps maintain a consistent voice across workshops.
