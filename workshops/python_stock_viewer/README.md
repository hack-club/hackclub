# Web Requests in Python - With a Stock Visualizer!

The [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library in Python is an easy way to integrate your program with resources online. It provides a simple way to work with HTTP requests, which are a vital part of most large applications.

## What are HTTP Requests?

HTTP requests are (leave for later)

## Importing the Libraries

For this program, we'll be using two libraries, the [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library to handle our HTTP requests and the [Json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) library to parse the values we get back from those requests into values that our code can understand.

Both these libraries are set up for us out of the box, so we won't need to install them. So boot into your IDE of choice, in my case [repl.it](https://repl.it) and add these lines to the program.

```python
import requests
import json
```

If you've ever worked with Python before, you know what these lines do. They allow your code to access these external libraries and work with them.
