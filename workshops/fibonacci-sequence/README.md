Hi Everyone! In this workshop, we will walk through how to build a **Fibonacci graph generator!**

### What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci Sequence is a peculiar series of numbers from classical mathematics that has found applications in advanced mathematics, nature, statistics, computer science, and Agile Development.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0, and 1.
The Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55…

First, you should read a bit on the Golden Spiral and its relationship with Fibonacci numbers. The Wikipedia article linked here provides a good start. If you want to explore more, visit the Golden Curve page on the website mathcurve.com as well.

Now you know that the Golden Spiral can be generated by drawing successive Fibonacci golden rectangles of dimension
*fn* − 1 ∗ *fn*
  
So, we are going to create a generator for this graph using Python!

You can see this project live on Repl.it by clicking [this](https://repl.it/@iamsid47/FibonacciV2) link.

## Let's Get Started!

![Create a repl](https://cloud-dqnxiplyi.vercel.app/0fibo-repl.png)

First, create a repl on [Repl.it] and choose Python as the language.

### Importing Modules

Initially, We'll import the following modules which are required for this project.

```python
import turtle
import math   
```

## Setting up display screen

Now, as we have imported the modules. We can set up a screen to display our Fibonacci graph generator. 

The below code will create a screen with a white background that has a width of 1000px and a height of 800px.

```python
  wn = turtle.Screen()
  wn.setup(1000,800)
  wn.bgcolor("white")
```


We have to create an object which will move around our screen and generates the graph. In this case, we have created an object named <b>myTur</b>. 

We can modify the shape of our object and it's color. 

The code given below creates a turtle-shaped object of blue color.

```python
  myTur = turtle.Turtle()  # sets turtle to x = 0 and y = 0 on screen, which displays the turtle at the centre of screen.
  myTur.pensize(5)
  myTur.color("Blue")
  myTur.shape("turtle")
```
We'll use the following code to create a start point to generate a curve, which we'll use later.

```python
myTurtle = turtle.Turtle()  # set turtle to x = 0 and y = 0 on screen
myTurtle.pensize(3)
myTurtle.color("red")
```
Now, Let's create the main function or you can say a driver program, which will calculate the value of the Fibonacci series and send it to the draw function which will create a visual representation of our graph.

```python
def main():             # this function calculate the value of fib and sends the results to the draw function
    valueOne = 0
    valueTwo = 1
    fib = 1
    myTur.fillcolor("black")
    myTur.begin_fill()
    for i in range(8):                      # number of squares to draw
        myTur.right(90)                  # point turtle to down position
        drawSq(fib*20)                      # call drawSq function-  argument = length of sides
        fib = valueOne + valueTwo           # calculate the value of Fibonacci
        valueOne = valueTwo
        valueTwo = fib
```
Following is the draw function which will create a series of rectangle whenever the function is invoked.

```python
def drawSq(sides):
    for n in range(6):                     # the value 6 ensures that the start of the next square is correct
        myTur.forward(sides)            # draw the sides of the squares
        myTur.left(90)                  # turn pointer left 90 degrees
```

If you run the code, you get a figure which displays a series of rectangles, one embedded inside the other.

### Golden Spiral

Golden Spiral
Using the above code, we can now plot the golden spiral. The idea here is to connect successive vertices of the rectangles using circular arcs to generate a spiral. The trick here is to identify the correct vertices of the rectangles which can be used to generate the arcs as the origin.

Here is a new function, which creates a spiral.


```python
def sprial():
    
    r = 20                                 # draws to size of the radius
    angle = 90
    myTurtle.right(90)                     # turn turtle to down position
    myTurtle.penup()
    myTurtle.setpos(0,0)                   # move turtle to starting point of first square
    myTurtle.pendown()
    # draw fibonacci spiral
    arc(20, angle)                         # call arc function  1 * 20 = 20
    arc(20, angle)                         # call arc function  1 * 20 = 20
    arc(40, angle)                         # call arc function  2 * 20 = 40
    arc(60, angle)                         # call arc function  3 * 20 = 60
    arc(100, angle)                        # call arc function  5 * 20 = 100
    arc(160,angle)                         # call arc function 8 * 20 = 160
    arc(260,angle)                         # call arc function 13 * 20 = 260
    arc(420,angle)                         # call arc function 21 * 20 = 420
```

The functions below create a curved line of red color, which connects successive vertices of the rectangles.

```python
def arcLine(n, length, angle):            # Draws n line segments.
    for i in range(n):
        myTurtle.forward(length)
        myTurtle.left(angle)

def arc(r, angle):                        #  Draws an arc with the given radius and angle
    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * abs(angle) / 360
    n = int(arc_length / 4) + 1
    step_length = arc_length / n
    step_angle = float(angle) / n
    # Before starting making a slight left turn.
    myTurtle.left(step_angle/2)
    arcLine(n, step_length, step_angle)
    myTurtle.right(step_angle/2)

```
And here is the golden curve it generates!

Now, to make this entire program functional and to generate the Fibonacci graph, you have to add the following lines of code, which will invoke all the functions mentioned above.

```python
# main program loop
main() 
myTur.end_fill()                           # calls the main function which draws the boxes
sprial()                                   # calls the spiral function which draws the sprial
wn.exitonclick()                           # click on the screen to exit the program

```

## Voila!

![You did it](https://media.giphy.com/media/d2Z9QYzA2aidiWn6/giphy.gif)

You just created history's most amazing graph generation application for mathematics!

## Hack It ;)

You can easily customize this generator to something other. For example, tweak the logical formula a bit.

Instead of printing the whole graph, you can just print the number on the **n***th* place.

It is also possible to the Fibonacci graph in a backward direction. Meaning that we start from infinite and then head over to one and finally zero. This is a bit hypothetical but it would be pretty cool to get answers from the generator like **infinite + x/n**. 

## Demos

Instead of generating a Fibonacci sequence which doesn't, it's also possible to generate a limited amount of it. In this [demo](https://repl.it/@iamsid47/fibo-demo-1), we define that till what value (n) do we want our graph.

Also, we can just generate the numerical sequence instead of generating the Golden Spiral for the Fibonacci Sequence. You can have a look at the demo [here](https://repl.it/@iamsid47/fibo-demo2).

There is also a very simple [version](https://repl.it/@iamsid47/fibo-demo3) of the Fibonacci sequence which shortlists the *prime numbers* in the sequence.
