Sometimes you want to share stuff between computers. You email it to yourself and then you log on to the other computer and then you find that you forgot your email password and then you click "forgot password" and then you find the code and then you enter the code and then you make a new password and then you type in the new password and then you find the email and then you *finally* copy the text and get on your way.

It took you 10 minutes just to get text from one computer to the other.

Then, you wonder - "What if, what if I could directly copy it to the other computer? I'd save 9.95 minutes!"

In this workshop, we'll make a program that can share clipboards between computers, so you can copy on one and paste on the others.

*^ Your face when it actually works*

## Requirements

You need:

- A Windows, macOS or Linux computer (you *could* also use Termux on an Android device but that might be hard)
- Basic Go knowledge (Get it from the official tour at [tour.golang.org](https://tour.golang.org) or from this ***excellent*** resource - [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com))

![End of list.](https://media.giphy.com/media/j529ybb5ZxD9rLFi8a/giphy.gif)

## Setup

- Install the Go programming language so we can write our program.
   - Head over to [golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install Go


- Install clipboard utilities so we can control the clipboard from code

(Just skip to instructions for your OS)

### Setup on macOS
(Psst! You can run this to install Go if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed: `brew install go`)

macOS already has clipboard utilities pre-installed! Try copying something (Here's some text: Hello, world!) and then running:
```sh
pbpaste
```
macOS has `pbcopy` for setting the clipboard

### Setup on Windows

Windows already has clipboard utilities pre-installed! Copy something and run this in a Powershell prompt:
```powershell
Get-Clipboard
```
or
```powershell
Set-Clipboard "guess what this does :)"
```

### Setup on Linux

Install at least one of [xclip](https://command-not-found.com/xclip), [xsel](https://command-not-found.com/xsel), [wl-clipboard](https://command-not-found.com/wl-copy)

Play around with the commands you installed!

### Setup on Android
Install the Termux app and Termux:API app from the Play Store. Then, install the Termux:API package from the command line (in Termux) using:

```sh
pkg install termux-api
```

## Building it!

To be able to sync clipboards, we need to be able to communicate between the devices. We'll do this through TCP sockets (which work over the internet). TCP is a protocol for communication, which means it's a ruleset that computers can follow to communicate.

Open up your favorite editor, make a new file titled `myclip.go` (you can name it whatever you want, really) and add in

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "errors"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "net"
    "os"
    "os/exec"
    "runtime"
    "strconv"
    "strings"
    "time"
)
```

These are all the Go packages we will be using in our program. Go complains about unused imports, so while testing code if you get an error about an unused import, just comment the import out.


### Variables

Add this in:
```go
var (
    secondsBetweenChecksForClipChange = 1
    helpMsg                           = `myclip - Shared Clipboard
With myclip, you can copy from one device and paste on another.

Usage: myclip [--debug/-d] [ <address> | --help/-h ]
Examples:
   myclip                          # start a new clipboard
   myclip 192.168.86.24:53701      # join the clipboard at 192.168.86.24:53701
   myclip -d                       # start a new clipboard with debug output
   myclip -d 192.168.86.24:53701   # join the clipboard with debug output
Running just ` + "`myclip`" + ` will start a new clipboard.
It will also provide an address with which you can connect to the same clipboard with another device.`
    listOfClients  = make([]*bufio.Writer, 0)
    localClipboard string
    printDebugInfo = false
    version        = "v1.0.0"
)
```

### The thing that starts everything

The main function, literally:
``` go
func main() {
    if len(os.Args) > 3 {
        handleError(errors.New("too many arguments"))
        fmt.Println(helpMsg)
        return
    }
    if hasOption, _ := argsHaveOption("help", "h"); hasOption {
        fmt.Println(helpMsg)
        return
    }
    if hasOption, i := argsHaveOption("debug", "d"); hasOption {
        printDebugInfo = true
        os.Args = removeElemFromSlice(os.Args, i) // delete the debug option and run again
        main()
        return
    }
    if hasOption, _ := argsHaveOption("version", "v"); hasOption {
        fmt.Println(version)
        return
    }
    if len(os.Args) == 2 { // has exactly one argument
        connectToServer(os.Args[1])
        return
    }
    makeServer() // if there's no arguments we should start a new clipboard
}
```

This should be very readable. A quirk of Go is that `os.Args` has the path to the binary as the first argument. This means that the first actual argument has the index 1 and not 0. When we do `len(os.Args)`, we're actually counting 1 extra. This means that `len(os.Args) > 3` will be true if there's more than 2 arguments.

To refresh your memory, an argument here is all the stuff you type after the command name:
```sh
ls myDir someFile lol
```
In this example, `myDir`, `someFile` and `lol` are the arguments to `ls`

If you try to compile this code you'll get a lot of errors. This is because there's a lot of functions missing. We'll write the code for these functions next.

This part just makes a new error that has the message "too many arguments" (lol as if that wasn't obvious):
```go
errors.New("too many arguments")
```

### Handle Errors
Let's make a function to handle errors:
```go
func handleError(err error) {
    if err == io.EOF {
        fmt.Println("Disconnected")
    } else {
        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "error: ["+err.Error()+"]")
    }
    return
}
```
if the error is an "End of File" error, we simply print "disconnected" (Because when a connection closes, that's the error that we'll handle), otherwise, we nicely format the error in brackets and output to stderr. It will look like this:
```
error: [the error message goes here]
```

### Check for options
Because this is going to be a CLI (Command Line Interface) app, we will need to parse options (for example, when you use `ls -l`, you're using the `-l` option). Add in:

```go
func argsHaveOption(long string, short string) (hasOption bool, foundAt int) {
    for i, arg := range os.Args {
        if arg == "--"+long || arg == "-"+short {
            return true, i
        }
    }
    return false, 0
}
```

![Wait wait wait.](https://media.tenor.com/images/b30c80d59700e5a1c577487775339b66/tenor.gif)

What does it do?

The purpose of the function is to let us check if an option was given.

The function takes in two strings and returns a true/false value and an integer.
The two strings are the two versions of the option - the short option and the long option. For example `grep -i` is the same as using `grep --ignore-case`. Here, `i` is the short version and `ignore-case` is the long one.

The function loops through the arguments and if the argument is either the long version or the short version, it returns true (to say: "yes, the option was found") and it also returns where it was found (the index), in case we need to do something with that (you'll see ðŸ™‚). If the loop finishes, which means the option wasn't found, it returns false and 0 because we have to return _something_.

### Remove stuff from slices

```go
func removeElemFromSlice(slice []string, i int) []string {
    return append(slice[:i], slice[i+1:]...)
}
```

This function works by "reslicing". It takes in the slice to remove the element from as well as the index of the thing that needs to be removed.

The `slice[:i]` part makes a new slice with all the elements before the `i`'th element and the `slice[i+1:]` part makes a new slice with all the elements after the `i`'th element. The `append()` function takes in a slice and then it accepts any number of elements to be added to the slice. What we want to do here is to append all the elements of `slice[i+1:]` so we do something called "unpacking" with `...` to change the slice into arguments.

Here's an example:
suppose we have a slice that looks like this:
```go
ourSlice := []string{"elem0", "elem1", "elem2", "elem3", "elem4"}
```
 and we want to remove `elem2`. We'll use the function we just wrote up like so:
 ```go
 removeElemFromSlice(ourSlice, 2)
 ```

 and then inside the function:

`slice[:2]` will become `{"elem0", "elem1"}`

`slice[3:]` will become `{"elem3", "elem4"}`

when the `append()` function is called, it will be the same as this:
```go
append(slice[:2], "elem3", "elem4")
```
because we "unpacked" the second slice, the append function just gets raw, plain arguments.

You can see that when these are appended, the "elem2" element is completely gone.

**As if it was never there**

![Neveeerrrrrrr](https://media.giphy.com/media/xEpTspH9hGwHS/giphy.gif)

For more info on reslicing (and just slices in general), check out this nice hands-on site: [gobyexample.com/slices](https://gobyexample.com/slices)

Remember, this is the place we used this function:
```go
if hasOption, i := argsHaveOption("debug", "d"); hasOption {
    printDebugInfo = true
    os.Args = removeElemFromSlice(os.Args, i) // delete the debug option and run again
    main()
    return
}
```

When I was first writing this code, I just thought that clearing the element and setting it to empty would be enough. Turns out that we'd have to properly remove the whole thing because if we don't, `len(os.Args)` will be one more than it should be (the empty element is still *counted* as an element)

### Get the local IP address

```go
func getOutboundIP() net.IP {
    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23558425/how-do-i-get-the-local-ip-address-in-go/37382208#37382208
    conn, err := net.Dial("udp", "8.8.8.8:80") // address can be anything. Doesn't even have to exist
    if err != nil {
        handleError(err)
        return nil
    }
    defer conn.Close()
    localAddr := conn.LocalAddr().(*net.UDPAddr)
    return localAddr.IP
}
```
This function gets the computers local IP address with which other computers can connect (you can see how this is useful).

The way it works is by checking what IP address the computer would use to connect to the internet.

### Make a server

```go
func makeServer() {
    fmt.Println("Starting a new clipboard")
    l, err := net.Listen("tcp4", "0.0.0.0:")
    if err != nil {
        handleError(err)
        return
    }
    defer l.Close()
    port := strconv.Itoa(l.Addr().(*net.TCPAddr).Port)
    fmt.Println("Run", "`myclip", getOutboundIP().String()+":"+port+"`", "to join this clipboard")
    fmt.Println()
    for {
        c, err := l.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            handleError(err)
            return
        }
        fmt.Println("Connected to a device")
        go handleClient(c)
    }
}
```

This makes a TCP server that listens for connections.

```go
l, err := net.Listen("tcp4", "0.0.0.0:")
```
This part makes the server and lets Go choose a free port that it can receive connections from.

```go
port := strconv.Itoa(l.Addr().(*net.TCPAddr).Port)
```
This just fetches the port that the server is listening on so that we can show this to the user and then the user can use it to connect to the server.

The `for` loop simply keeps getting connections from the server and sends them to a different function which can then handle them. This is done in a new "goroutine" or thread so we can keep listening for more connections and handle the client at the same time.

More info about ports, TCP and how the internet works at [www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets/)

### Debug function
```go
func debug(a ...interface{}) {
    if printDebugInfo {
        fmt.Println("verbose:", a)
    }
}
```
This function takes any number of arguments, nicely formats them in brackets, and prints it out if `printDebugInfo` is `true`. We keep it false unless the user uses the debug option. Here's the relevant piece of `main()` code:

```go
if hasOption, i := argsHaveOption("debug", "d"); hasOption {
    printDebugInfo = true
    os.Args = removeElemFromSlice(os.Args, i) // delete the debug option and run again
    main()
    return
}
```

### Handle the client

```go
func handleClient(c net.Conn) {
    w := bufio.NewWriter(c)
    listOfClients = append(listOfClients, w)
    defer c.Close()
    go monitorSentClips(bufio.NewReader(c))
    monitorLocalClip(w)
}
```
Get a writer from the connection so we can communicate with the client and add the client to a list of clients so that when we get the clipboard, we can send it to everyone (every client). Now we start another thread which will check for clipboards sent by the client. We input the connection's reader so that the function (`monitorSentClips()`) can get messages sent by the client.

Then we start another function that will check for changes to our own clipboard - the local clipboard - and send the clipboard if it has changed.

### Connect to server if we are the client

```go
func connectToServer(address string) {
    c, err := net.Dial("tcp4", address)
    if err != nil {
        handleError(err)
        return
    }
    defer c.Close()
    fmt.Println("Connected to the clipboard")
    go monitorSentClips(bufio.NewReader(c))
    monitorLocalClip(bufio.NewWriter(c))
}
```

Now what if we are the client? If we are the client, we need to connect to the server using the address that the user gives us. 

Remember, we get the address from this block of code in `main()`:
```go
if len(os.Args) == 2 { // has exactly one argument 
    connectToServer(os.Args[1])
    return
}
```

Then we check for changes to our own clipboard and also the clipboards sent by the server.

### Check for changes to the local clipboard

```go
func monitorLocalClip(w *bufio.Writer) {
    for {
        localClipboard = getLocalClip()
        debug("clipboard changed so sending it. localClipboard =", localClipboard)
        err := sendClipboard(w, localClipboard)
        if err != nil {
            handleError(err)
            return
        }
        for localClipboard == getLocalClip() {
            time.Sleep(time.Second * time.Duration(secondsBetweenChecksForClipChange))
        }
    }
}
```
We get the local clipboard and send it. Then in the `for` loop while the clipboard remains the same as last time, we wait. 

(we check every second because we set `secondsBetweenChecksForClipChange` to 1 when declaring variables. You can change it!)

When it is no longer the same, we get out of that for loop (This one: `for localClipboard == getLocalClip()`) and then send the new clipboard to the client. (Remember that when calling this function we input the writer to the client).

We have ANOTHER function to send the clipboard to a writer.

At this point, you're like "omg so many functions it never ends" but in the end it's more readable, it's neater, it's easier to understand and it's easier to manage. A few minutes of looking at the entire source code will convince you of this.

### Check for sent clipboards
This is by far the largest function:
```go
func monitorSentClips(r *bufio.Reader) {
    var foreignClipboard string
    for {
        s, err := r.ReadString('\n')
        if err != nil {
            handleError(err)
            return
        }
        if s == "STARTCLIPBOARD\n" {
            for {
                s, err = r.ReadString('\n')
                if err != nil {
                    handleError(err)
                    return
                }
                if s == "ENDCLIPBOARD\n" {
                    foreignClipboard = strings.TrimSuffix(foreignClipboard, "\n")
                    break
                }
                foreignClipboard += s
            }
            setLocalClip(foreignClipboard)
            localClipboard = foreignClipboard // the local clipboard monitoring thread should still get that localClipboard is the same as the local clipboard.
            debug("rcvd:", foreignClipboard)
            for i, w := range listOfClients {
                if w != nil {
                    debug("Sending received clipboard to", w)
                    err := sendClipboard(w, foreignClipboard)
                    if err != nil {
                        listOfClients[i] = nil
                        fmt.Println("error when trying to send the clipboard to a device. Will not contact that device again.")
                        //handleError(err)
                    }
                }
            }
            foreignClipboard = ""
        }
    }
}
```

We define a string at the start to hold sent clipboards.

Then we have a huge `for` loop so that we can keep checking for sent clipboards. Inside this `for` loop is everything else. 

We read one line using the `ReadString()` function which takes in a character. How it works is that the function keeps reading until it hits that one character (we chose `"\n"` so we get each line separately) and then returns whatever it found till then *including that one character*. So it basically gives us the next line of input with a newline char at the end.

Then we check if this is the start of a clipboard by checking `if s == "STARTCLIPBOARD\n"`. 

We have yet another for loop that keeps reading more lines and keeps adding them to `foreignClipboard` so we get all of the sent clipboard *until* we find that `s == "ENDCLIPBOARD\n"`. When we see this, we remove the ending newline from `foreignClipboard` because `ReadString()` attaches an extra newline at the end of `s`

So now we have parsed the clipboard and we have it stored in `foreignClipboard`. We set the local clipboard to the sent one (so that both are synced. Our clipboard and the clipboard from far, far away are both the same now)

Then we print what we found if we should (`debug("rcvd:", foreignClipboard)`) and then we have ANOTHER `for` loop in which we send every client which is not `nil` the new clipboard. If we get an error while sending, we set the writer to `nil` so we don't contact him again. This is because we'll get an error after sending if the client simply disconnects (we obviously don't want to contact a client if it's already disconnected). And then when we're done wth sending the clipboard to everyone, we simply reset `foreignClipboard` to `""` so that we can continue getting more clipboards and then this whole cycle starts again!

One thing to note: if this is a client, `listOfClients` will just be empty (look at the source code to convince yourself of this). This means that nothing happens in that for loop if you're a client. When the clipboard is sent, the client will just set it's own clipboard and do nothing else. If it's a server, it'll send all the clients the clipboard as well as set it's own clipboard.

### Send the clipboard

The reason we have a seperate function for sending the clipboard is so both the server and the client can send clipboards to each other and we don't have to use duplicate code.

```go
func sendClipboard(w *bufio.Writer, clipboard string) error {
    var err error
    clipString := "STARTCLIPBOARD\n" + clipboard + "\nENDCLIPBOARD\n"
    if clipboard == "" {
        debug("was going to send empty string but skipping")
        return nil
    }
    debug("sent:", clipboard)
    _, err = w.WriteString(clipString)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    err = w.Flush()
    return err
}
```
This function sends the clipboard to a writer and returns an error if anything goes wrong. We return the error so that we can check for clients that are unreachable and if they are, we can remove them from the list.

Sometimes the code gets an empty clipboard for some reason (I have no idea why. Please do tell me if you find out why. I'm **@Ishan** on Slack) so we have this in place to check if it is empty and to not send it if it is empty so that the other computers don't get their clipboards emptied (tongue twister, eh?):
```go
if clipboard == "" {
    debug("was going to send empty string but skipping")
    return nil
}
```

When we're sending the clipboard, we put "STARTCLIPBOARD" over it and "ENDCLIPBOARD" below it so that when we're parsing the clipboard the parser knows where one clipboard ends and where another starts (we'll be sending multiple clipboards because they can change, you know).




### Get the local clipboard

```go
func getLocalClip() string {
    var out []byte
    var err error
    var cmd *exec.Cmd
    if runtime.GOOS == "darwin" { // darwin means it's macOS
        cmd = exec.Command("pbpaste")
    } else if runtime.GOOS == "windows" {
        cmd = exec.Command("powershell.exe", "-command", "Get-Clipboard")
    } else {
        // Unix - check what's available
        if _, err := exec.LookPath("xclip"); err == nil {
            cmd = exec.Command("xclip", "-out", "-selection", "clipboard")
        } else if _, err := exec.LookPath("xsel"); err == nil {
            cmd = exec.Command("xsel", "--output", "--clipboard")
        } else if _, err := exec.LookPath("wl-paste"); err == nil {
            cmd = exec.Command("wl-paste", "--no-newline")
        } else if _, err := exec.LookPath("termux-clipboard-get"); err == nil {
            cmd = exec.Command("termux-clipboard-get")
        } else {
            handleError(errors.New("sorry, myclip won't work if you don't have xsel, xclip, wayland or Termux installed :("))
            os.Exit(2)
        }
    }
    if out, err = cmd.Output(); err != nil {
        handleError(err)
        return "An error occurred wile getting the local clipboard"
    }
    if runtime.GOOS == "windows" {
        return strings.TrimSuffix(string(out), "\r\n") // powershell's get-clipboard adds a windows newline to the end for some reason
    }
    return string(out)
}
```


We define some helper variables and then we check for different OSs because different OSs will have different commands for getting the clipboard. In Go, you can check the OS using the variable `runtime.GOOS`. 

The `exec.Command()` function lets you run commands found installed on the computer. (Like commands you can run in the terminal: ls, cd, etc.)

We set the `cmd` variable to whatever pre-installed command should be run.

For OSs which do not have clipboard utilities pre-installed we have to do a slightly more complicated thing. If the OS is not macOS or Windows, we use the `exec.LookPath()` function to see what's installed. (It returns the path to the binary we search for and an `error` variable)

We check for binaries. For each check we do, if the error is nil - which means that the command was found and can be used - we set `cmd` to the command we need to use to get the clipboard. 

For example, if we have `xclip` installed on a linux system, `exec.LookPath()` will return no error and so we'll use the command `xclip -out -selection clipboard` to get the clipboard.

If we don't find any of the utilities installed, we make a new error and shutdown the entire program. (`os.Exit(2)` will exit with status code 2) 

`cmd.Output()` then runs the command and returns the output as a slice of bytes (this will be the clipboard because that's what the command does). If we find that there is an error, we handle the error and then return "An error occurred wile getting the local clipboard" as the clipboard because if we have to return something, why not make it descriptive.

On Windows, the powershell command attaches a newline at the end of the clipboard for who knows what reason so we remove that. 

Then, we finally return the clipboard after converting the slice of bytes to a string! 




### Set the local clipboard
This part is very similar to the "Get the local clipboard" part
```go
func setLocalClip(s string) {
    var copyCmd *exec.Cmd

This function takes in a string to set the clipboard to.

Just like the last part, we have a command variable and then we look for what's available and all that.

After that is the part that is different. The `in` variable let's us write to the input of the command. We start the command. Then, we convert the string to a byte slice and feed it into the command. The command then does our work for us and sets the computer's clipboard to the string we fed into it.

The command is like:

![I'm doing my part](https://media.giphy.com/media/YYfEjWVqZ6NDG/giphy.gif)

We wait for the command to complete its job and we close the writer and we're on our way!

## The End

Save your code!
Now let's see if it works:
```sh
go build myclip.go
./myclip --help
```
The help info should help you run and test it. You can also edit the help info by changing the variables!

Try out:
```sh
./myclip --debug
```
and follow the instructions it gives you.

Because this is a CLI, it is recommended to include a version option.

Try out:
```sh
./myclip --version
```

Check if the short forms work:
```sh
./myclip -v
```

Try it out with other devices you own or with your friend (you'll have to be connected to the same WiFi or local network)!

Tinker with the code! Mess around! Experiment!

Some things you could improve:

- Follow [clig.dev](https://clig.dev) better
- Add in debug levels (`./myclip --debug 2`)
- Make the output beautiful!

This workshop was based off my Uniclip project: [github.com/quackduck/uniclip](https://github.com/quackduck/uniclip)

## The full source code
It's pretty long
```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "errors"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "net"
    "os"
    "os/exec"
    "runtime"
    "strconv"
    "strings"
    "time"
)

var (
    secondsBetweenChecksForClipChange = 1
    helpMsg                           = `myclip - Shared Clipboard
With myclip, you can copy from one device and paste on another.

Usage: myclip [--debug/-d] [ <address> | --help/-h ]
Examples:
   myclip                          # start a new clipboard
   myclip 192.168.86.24:53701      # join the clipboard at 192.168.86.24:53701
   myclip -d                       # start a new clipboard with debug output
   myclip -d 192.168.86.24:53701   # join the clipboard with debug output
Running just ` + "`myclip`" + ` will start a new clipboard.
It will also provide an address with which you can connect to the same clipboard with another device.`
