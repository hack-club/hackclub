# Rebar

You probably must have built navbars for your websites. It is a challenging task for many of us to make a good and responsive navbar. Well, today we'll be building a fully responsive navbar! It is not only easy to build but also very smooth and beautiful!

But first, Let's have a look on various navbars on the internet:

The responsive nav:

And this is what we'll be building today!

Here's a sneak peek:

[![sneak peek](https://cloud-kezdm1i9q.vercel.app/workshop-nav.gif)](https://responsive-navbar.faisalsayed1.repl.co/)

Here's the [live demo](https://responsive-navbar.faisalsayed1.repl.co/).  
Here's the [source code](https://repl.it/@FaisalSayed1/Responsive-Navbar).

## Part 1: Prerequisites

You should have a beginner understanding of:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Part 2: Setup

### Setting up your code environment on Repl.it

[Repl.it](https://repl.it) is an online code editor. You don't have to use Repl.it but I suggest you do as it sets everything up for you and you don't require any installations.

To get started, go to [https://repl.it/languages/html](https://repl.it/languages/html). Your coding environment will spin up in just a few seconds!

You should see something like the following:

## Part 3: Building the project

### 1) HTML

Let's start writing the HTML code required in the `index.html` file. We'll write all our code inside the `<body></body>` tags.

**NOTE:** Make Make sure the `<script>` tag, which is in your body, is just above the closing `</body>` tag and whatever code you write in the `<body>` should be above that `<script>` tag or else it will throw you errors.

First, we'll build a simple structure of the Navbar:

```html
<body>
  <nav class="navbar">
    <ul class="elements">
      <li class="nav-el">HOME</li>
      <li class="nav-el">ABOUT</li>
      <li class="nav-el">CONTACT</li>
      <li class="nav-el">PROJECTS</li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

Explanation: In the `<nav>` element, we create an unordered list (`<ul>`) with the list items (`<li>`) as navlinks.

Also, the `<nav>` element has a class of `navbar`, the `<ul>` has a class of `elements`, the `<li>` has a class of `nav-el` and as always, the  `<script>` tag is below all these lines.

Now, we will also create a burger button which will only be visible for smaller screens and it will make the navbar pop up from the side. It will come below the unordered list inside the `<nav>` element.

```html
<div class="burgerDiv">
  <div class="rows">
    <div class="span"></div>
    <div class="span"></div>
    <div class="span"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Explanation: The burger button lines will be nested inside 2 `<div>` tags. Similarly, the first parent `<div>` has a class of `burgerDiv`, the second parent `<div>` has a class of `rows` and each of the burger lines have a class of `span`.

If you run the code now, you will see an unordered list in the preview similar to this:

![testing](https://cloud-agu2nwz83.vercel.app/image.png)

Umm... Why didn't our button render? That's because its default width and height are 0 pixels. We will need to specify its size in the CSS.

<details>
<summary>The HTML code so far:</summary>

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Responsive Navbar</title>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav class="navbar">
      <ul class="elements">
        <li class="nav-el">HOME</li>
        <li class="nav-el">ABOUT</li>
        <li class="nav-el">CONTACT</li>
        <li class="nav-el">PROJECTS</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="burgerDiv">
        <div class="rows">
          <div class="span"></div>
          <div class="span"></div>
          <div class="span"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </nav>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
```

</details>

Without any further ado, let's move on to the CSS!

### 2) CSS

Navigate to the `style.css` file and let's start by removing the default margin and the default padding from all the elements. To do that, we'll simply write:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

Next we will style the `<ul>` so that it looks more like a navbar and not a list.

The `<ul>` tag was given a class of `elements`. So we will give styles to `elements` class.

```css
.elements {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  list-style: none;
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
  color: whitesmoke;
  font-weight: 500;
  font-size: 20px;
  background-color: #89a0ce;
  transition: 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);
}
```

Woah woah woah. Too much of CSS in one go, right? Don't worry, I'll explain you everything line by line.

Explanation: We make the display of that element to `flex` so that we can align it horizontally. Then we give a property of `justify-content: space-evenly;` so that the contents inside the elements are spaced properly.

An elaborate explanation of `justify-content` and its various properties:

![justify-content](https://cloud-2tk3mfz9w.vercel.app/image.png)

Image courtesy: [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

Next, we have the `list-style: none;` which will remove the bulleted points which are default to unordered lists. Then we give the element some extra space on top and bottom using the `padding-top: 10px;` and `padding-bottom: 10px;`

Next, the `color`, `font-weight`, `font-size` properties are defined which will affect the text inside the element. The `background-color: #89a0ce;` property is pretty much self explanatory. Then we give it some transition properties of 0.5 seconds as the transition duration and the transition effect as `cubic-bezier`.

Learn about [cubic bezier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-cubic-bezier-function/).

Next, we'll add some CSS properties to the `burgerDiv`, `rows` and `span` respectively.

```css
.rows {
  cursor: pointer;
}

.span {
  width: 30px;
  height: 4px;
  background-color: black;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  border-radius: 2px;
  transition: 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.320, 1);
}
```

Explanation: The `rows` element has a property of `cursor` set to `pointer` so whenever you hover your mouse over that element, your cursor will change to pointer. Next, the burger lines (`span`) get a width of 30px and a height of 4px. It also has a background color of black, then it has a `margin-bottom` of 5px and a `border-radius` of 2px so as to get that smooth finishing. Also, just like above, it has a transition property - 0.5 seconds of duration and `cubic-bezier` is the type of effect applied to it.

Let's click on 'RUN' and test it out!

![Testing of our code](https://cloud-6tjatnh5x.vercel.app/image.png)

Here, you can see the list in the form of navbar and you can also see the burger button. Notice when you hover on it, your cursor will change to `pointer`.

Also, we don't want the burger button to be displayed now, so we will make it to `display: none;`

```css
.burgerDiv {
  display: none;
}
```

<details>
<summary>Here's the code so far:</summary>

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.elements {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  list-style: none;
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
  color: whitesmoke;
  font-weight: 500;
  font-size: 20px;
  background-color: #89a0ce;
  transition: 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);
}

.rows {
  cursor: pointer;
}

.span {
  width: 30px;
  height: 4px;
  background-color: black;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  border-radius: 2px;
  transition: 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.320, 1);
}

.burgerDiv {
  display: none;
}
```
</details>

Next, we will add a media query. Now what are media queries? Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width). A normal mobile device's width is somewhat 450px.

So we can write the media query such that:
```css
@media (max-width: 450px) {

}
```

Learn more about [`media-queries`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries).

Now, all the styles which come under this query will only be applied when the `max-width:450px` condition is true.

Here, we will make our navbar vertical instead of horizontal and we'll push it off screen.
```css
@media (max-width: 450px) {
  .elements {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    position: absolute;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 35%;
    height: 100%;
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
}
```

Explanation: When the screen resolution becomes less than 450px, these styles will get applied. So here, we make the `flex-direction` of the navbar to `column`, we align the items to center and we make the `position` to `absolute` so it can somewhat float on the browser screen without disturbing other elements on the page.

All the `margins` are removed and a `padding` of 20px is applied. The `width` is set to 35% so it will take 35% width of the screen. `height` is 100% so the navbar is spread throughout the page vertically. 

A `transform` property is applied which specifies the element's x position on the screen. The element is -100% in the x direction (which is offscreen).

Now if you click 'RUN' and if the preview window's width is more than 450px, you'll see everything normal. Try shrinking down the preview window and at a point, you'll see the navbar go offscreen vertically.

![Navbar test](https://cloud-7bj5jyaas.vercel.app/media-query-test.gif)

Next, we will also make the burger button visible as it is set to `display: none;`

```css
@media (max-width: 450px) {
  ... // rest of the code above

  .burgerDiv {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
    margin-left: 20px;
    padding-top: 20px;
  }
}
```
Explanation: When the screen resolution gets smaller than 450px, we set the burger button's `display` to `flex`, `flex-direction` to `column` and also align it to `flex-start` so that it is on the top left corner of the page.

That is pretty much it for the media query and let's test it out. We'll see that the burger button pops up in the corner and the navbar gets shifted off screen.

![Burger button test](https://cloud-j9jziti6y.vercel.app/media-query-test2.gif)

<details><summary>Your code so far:</summary>

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.elements {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  list-style: none;
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
  color: whitesmoke;
  font-weight: 500;
  font-size: 20px;
  background-color: #89a0ce;
  transition: 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);
}

.rows {
  cursor: pointer;
}

.span {
  width: 30px;
  height: 4px;
  background-color: black;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  border-radius: 2px;
  transition: 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.320, 1);
}

.burgerDiv {
  display: none;
}

@media (max-width: 450px) {
  .elements {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    position: absolute;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 35%;
    height: 100%;
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
  .burgerDiv {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
    margin-left: 20px;
    padding-top: 20px;
  }
}
```

</details>


*Outside the media query, We'll add some styles to the classes which don't even exist.* 

*Wait what? why?*  
*--> To waste your precious time.*

*Okay... Okay... Just kidding... That non existing classes hold some importance. FINE? Oh God. I'm not wasting your precious time...*

Let's start by adding styles to a class named `sidebar`.

```css
.sidebar {
  transform: translateX(0px);
}
```

*And more styles.*

```css
.line-0 {
  transform: rotate(45deg) translate(4.5px, 12px);
}

.line-1 {
  transform: scale(0);
}

.line-2 {
  transform: rotate(-45deg) translateY(-7.5px);
}
```

*And more styles.*  
*Just kidding that's it. 👀*

Explanation: Remember we placed our navbar offscreen? Yes, so to bring it back on screen, we defined the class `sidebar` which will transform its x position from -100% to 0. We will toggle this class into our navbar using JavaScript later.

Also, the next three classes are defined with the purpose of bringing an animation in the button when it is clicked. We will rotate the first and the third line of the burger button so that it will look like a close button (X). The middle line gets hidden as we scale it down to 0. This will also be toggled using JavaScript.

Refer [here](https://repl.it/@FaisalSayed1/Responsive-Navbar#style.css) for the CSS code so far.

And with dozens of lines of CSS code, let's move on to JavaScript.

### 3) JavaScript

*Honestly, there are just nearly 10 lines of code. So hang tight and don't freak out!*

First we will link the navbar, the burger button and each line of the burger button to some variables. Confused? You'll get it in a moment.

```js
const nav = document.querySelector(".elements");
const button = document.querySelector(".rows");
const lines = document.querySelectorAll(".span");
```

Explanation: The first variable `nav` contains the whole navbar. The second variable `button` contains the whole burger button.

Notice that we used `querySelector()` for the first 2 variables but `querySelectorAll()` for the last one.

Now first of all, what even is a `querySelector()`?  
The `querySelector()` returns the first element within the document that matches the specified selector(s).

So, `querySelectorAll()` returns all the elements that matches the specified selector. Just like that, in the 3rd line, all the elements with the class of `span` get selected and they are stored in a `NodeList`.

Now `NodeLists` are somewhat similar to `Arrays` and `Objects` but they are not `Arrays` or `Objects`. We don't need to go deeper into it but if you want to learn more about it then check [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) out.

So that means all 3 of the burger button lines are now stored in the `lines` variable.

Next, we will create a `toggler()` function and we will toggle the styles and animations (which are stored in the extra classes which we made).

```js
function toggler() {
  nav.classList.toggle("sidebar");
  lines[0].classList.toggle("line-0");
  lines[1].classList.toggle("line-1");
  lines[2].classList.toggle("line-2");
}
```

Explanation: The navbar will get a class of `sidebar` when the function will be called for the first time and that class will get removed when the function will be called the next time. 

Also, as the `lines` variable is a `NodeList`, we can access each element in it using its index. So, the first burger button line gets toggled with the class of `line-0` and in the same way the next two lines get toggled with their respective classes.

Now, we need to call this function every time the button gets clicked, so we will add an `event listener` on the button outside the function.

```js
button.addEventListener("click", toggler);
```

Explanation: Now, whenever the button will be clicked, the `toggler()` function will be called.
