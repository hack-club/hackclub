Fractals. You've seen them. They're beautiful:

What kind of crazy black magic lets computers draw these things?? It must be like… really complicated.

WRONG. Fractal renderers are _ridiculously_ simple—and to prove it, you're going to write one.

## The Complex Plane

Fractals arise from basic arithmetic with **complex numbers**. Despite their name, complex numbers are actually quite simple; instead of a number _line_, complex numbers exist on a _plane_.

Complex numbers are usually written `x+y*i`. So `2+4i` is at the point (2, 4).

![Mousing around the Complex Plane](/img/complex_plane_mouse.gif)

`i` is the square root of -1 (so `i*i=-1`). We can't find a value for `i` on the "real" number line, because `x*x` is _never_ negative.

For a long time, mathematicians just ignored square roots of negative numbers—just like they used to ignore negative numbers. _They aren't "real" numbers, so what good are they?_

Then somebody thought to put `i` on its own separate, _vertical_ number line. The **Complex Plane** was born—you won't believe what happened next.

### From Pixels to Points

Each _pixel_ on our canvas corresponds to a _point_ on the complex plane. We need a function to convert XY pixels to complex points.

Complex numbers aren't "built in" for most programming languages. We'll use a library called math.js to work with them in JavaScript. To create a new complex number with math.js, we simply write `math.complex(x, y)`

Add a function called `pixelToPoint` to the end of your script:

```javascript
// the rest of your script...

// Turn XY pixel coordinates into a point on the complex plane
function pixelToPoint(x, y) {
  // Map percentage of total width/height to a value from -1 to +1
  var zx = (x / width) * 2 - 1
  var zy = 1 - (y / height) * 2

  // Create a complex number based on our new XY values
  return math.complex(zx, zy)
}
```

This takes the X and Y coordinates for a pixel, divides each to get that pixel's percentage of the overall width/height, and maps that percentage to a value from -1 to +1. The result is a point between `-1-1i` and `1+1i`.

Note how `zx` is `(x/width)*2-1`, but `zy` is `1-(y/height)*2`. `zy` is flipped—this is just because on a webpage, pixel coordinates go top-to-bottom (and we want our complex plane to be bottom-to-top).

Now let's use that function to pick out a point on the plane with the mouse. Later on we'll need a point called `constant` for our fractal equation, so let's use that.

Add a complex number called `constant` to the top of your script, just before `pixelToPoint` and just after `mouseX`/`mouseY`:

```javascript
// mouseX/mouseY + the rest of your script...

// The point we use for C in our Julia Set equation
var constant = math.complex(0.28, 0.01)

// pixelToPoint + the rest of your script...
```

Now let's hook up the mouse to the canvas.

Add two new functions called `update` and `move` to the end of your script. `move` will fire every time the mouse moves to a new point on the canvas, and `update` will change the header to show that point.

We'll also add an event listener to the canvas to trigger `move`:

```javascript
// pixelToPoint + the rest of your script...

// Update the elements that need to change
function update() {
  header.innerHTML = constant.toString()
}

// What to do when the mouse moves over the canvas
function move(event) {
  // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
  mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
  mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

  // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
  constant = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

  // Round that point off to the nearest 0.01
  constant.re = math.round(constant.re * 100) / 100
  constant.im = math.round(constant.im * 100) / 100

  // Update everything!
  update()
}

// Trigger move every time the mouse moves over canvas
canvas.addEventListener('pointermove', move)
```

Note that we're rounding `constant` to the nearest 0.01:

```javascript
constant.re = math.round(constant.re * 100) / 100
constant.im = math.round(constant.im * 100) / 100
```

This just looks a little neater. `constant.re` is the "real" part of the number—the X value. `constant.im` is the "imaginary" part—the Y value.

Now if you run the page and mouse over the canvas, you should see `constant` updating in the header!

![Selecting points on the complex plane](/img/julia_fractal_constant.gif)

Your whole script should look like [this](https://repl.it/@polytrope/julia-fractals-complex-plane):

```html
<script>
  // The HTML elements we are using
  var header = document.querySelector('h2')
  var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

  // The size of our canvas
  var width = 200
  var height = 200

  // Set the size of our canvas
  canvas.width = width
  canvas.height = height

  // The XY coordinates of the mouse over the canvas
  var mouseX = 0
  var mouseY = 0

  // The point we use for C in our Julia Set equation
  var constant = math.complex(0.28, 0.01)

  // Turn XY pixel coordinates into a point on the complex plane
  function pixelToPoint(x, y) {
    // Map percentage of total width/height to a value from -1 to +1
    var zx = (x / width) * 2 - 1
    var zy = 1 - (y / height) * 2

    // Create a complex number based on our new XY values
    return math.complex(zx, zy)
  }

  // Update the elements that need to change
  function update() {
    header.innerHTML = constant.toString()
  }

  // What to do when the mouse moves over the canvas
  function move(event) {
    // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
    mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
    mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

    // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
    constant = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

    // Round that point off to the nearest 0.01
    constant.re = math.round(constant.re * 100) / 100
    constant.im = math.round(constant.im * 100) / 100

    // Update everything!
    update()
  }

  // Trigger move every time the mouse moves over canvas
  canvas.addEventListener('pointermove', move)
</script>
```

## Drawing Pixels

Let's draw some colors on our canvas. Every _pixel_ maps to a _point_, and every _point_ maps to a _color_.

Let's make it so that every time we change `constant` we draw in a color for that pixel.

To do this, we need a new function called `pointToColor`. This function will turn any point into an RGB color, simply by using the "real" (X) value `point.re` for Red and the "imaginary" (Y) value `point.im` for green:

```javascript
// constant + the rest of your script...

// Turn a point on the complex plane into a color
function pointToColor(point) {
  var red = point.re * 255
  var green = point.im * 255
  return `rgb(${red}, ${green}, 0)`
}

// pixelToPoint + the rest of your script...
```

We will also need two more functions, called `drawPixel` and `draw`.

`drawPixel` will draw a given color at a given pixel. `draw` will

```javascript
// pixelToPoint + the rest of your script...

// Draw a single pixel on our canvas
function drawPixel(x, y, color) {
  ctx.fillStyle = color
  ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1)
}

// Redraw our canvas
function draw() {
  // Turn the point under the mouse into a color
  var color = pointToColor(constant)

  // Draw over the pixel under the mouse with that color
  drawPixel(mouseX, mouseY, color)
}

// update + the rest of your script...
```

Let's quickly look at `drawPixel`. This is how basic drawing works with canvas.

First you set properties like `fillStyle` on the "drawing context" (usually labelled `ctx`). Then you trigger a drawing operation like `fillRect` to draw shapes onto the canvas—in this case, a single 1x1 rectangle.

Finally, we need to add `draw()` to `update` so that our canvas will redraw anytime we call `update`:

```javascript
// draw + the rest of your script...

// Update the elements that need to change
function update() {
  header.innerHTML = constant.toString()
  draw()
}

// move + the rest of your script...
```

Now if you run the page, you should see little colored pixels show up as you mouse over the plane:

![Drawing in pixels on the complex plane](/img/julia_fractal_pixels.gif)

Your script should now look like [this](https://repl.it/@polytrope/julia-fractals-drawing-pixels):

```html
<script>
  // The HTML elements we are using
  var header = document.querySelector('h2')
  var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

  // The size of our canvas
  var width = 200
  var height = 200

  // Set the size of our canvas
  canvas.width = width
  canvas.height = height

  // The XY coordinates of the mouse over the canvas
  var mouseX = 0
  var mouseY = 0

  // The point we use for C in our Julia Set equation
  var constant = math.complex(0.28, 0.01)

  // Turn a point on the complex plane into a color
  function pointToColor(point) {
    var red = point.re * 255
    var green = point.im * 255
    return `rgb(${red}, ${green}, 0)`
  }

  // Turn XY pixel coordinates into a point on the complex plane
  function pixelToPoint(x, y) {
    // Map percentage of total width/height to a value from -1 to +1
    var zx = (x / width) * 2 - 1
    var zy = 1 - (y / height) * 2

    // Create a complex number based on our new XY values
    return math.complex(zx, zy)
  }

  // Draw a single pixel on our canvas
  function drawPixel(x, y, color) {
    ctx.fillStyle = color
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1)
  }

  // Redraw our canvas
  function draw() {
    // Turn the point under the mouse into a color
    var color = pointToColor(constant)

    // Draw over the pixel under the mouse with that color
    drawPixel(mouseX, mouseY, color)
  }

  // Update the elements that need to change
  function update() {
    header.innerHTML = constant.toString()
    draw()
  }

  // What to do when the mouse moves over the canvas
  function move(event) {
    // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
    mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
    mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

    // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
    constant = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

    // Round that point off to the nearest 0.01
    constant.re = math.round(constant.re * 100) / 100
    constant.im = math.round(constant.im * 100) / 100

    // Update everything!
    update()
  }

  // Trigger move every time the mouse moves over canvas
  canvas.addEventListener('pointermove', move)
</script>
```

## Drawing the Plane

We don't just want to draw one pixel at a time—we want the whole plane at once.

Let's modify our `draw` function so it fills in _every_ pixel:

```javascript
// drawPixel + the rest of your script

// Redraw our canvas
function draw() {
  // Loop over every column of pixels
  for (var y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    // Loop over every row of pixels
    for (var x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      // Turn this pixel into a point in the complex plane
      var point = pixelToPoint(x, y)

      // Turn that point into a color
      var color = pointToColor(point)

      // Draw over this pixel with that color
      drawPixel(x, y, color)
    }
  }
}

// update + the rest of your script...
```

This new `draw` function is actually pretty simple. It uses two loops—one for X and one for Y—to go over every pixel in our canvas. Then it gets the complex plane point for that pixel. Then it gets the color for that point. Then it draws that color at that pixel.

If you run the page, you should see the same field of red/green pixels—only now they are all filled in!

![Drawing in pixels on the complex plane](/img/julia_fractal_pixels_filled.png)

The only problem is that the page waits for the mouse to move before drawing the canvas. Let's fix that with a call to `update` at the end of our script, just after we add the event listener:

```javascript
// addEventListener + the rest of your script...

// Update everything!
update()
```

### Simple Complex Arithmetic

Let's make a few more changes to our `pointToColor` function, just to understand what's going on. First, try adding

`point = point.sub(constant)`

To the top of `pointToColor`:

```javascript
// constant + the rest of your script...

// Turn a point on the complex plane into a color
function pointToColor(point) {
  point = point.sub(constant)

  var red = point.re * 255
  var green = point.im * 255

  return `rgb(${red}, ${green}, 0)`
}

// pixelToPoint + the rest of your script...
```

This means we _subtract_ `constant` from our `point` before we turn it into a color. Since complex numbers aren't built into JavaScript, we can't use `+-*/`—math.js has us use `.add()` `.sub()` `.mul()` `.div()` instead.

What does it mean to add/subtract a complex number? Well, it's pretty much the same as adding regular numbers: 1+2i + 1+2i = 2+4i.

However, there is a better, more _geometric_ way to think about this: we are using one point to _move_ another point _around the plane_:

![Adding points on the Complex Plane](/img/complex_plane_add.gif)

And if you run the page, this is exactly what you should see—when we _subtract_ the mouse position from each point before turning it into a color, the entire plane will move with the mouse:

![Moving the complex plane with the mouse](/img/julia_fractal_add.gif)

What a convenient geometric representation!

As it turns out, you can _multiply_ complex numbers too. Amazingly, this also has a simple geometric interpretation: _rotation_ and _scaling_:

![Multiplying points on the Complex Plane](/img/complex_plane_multiply.gif)

Try changing this line:

`point = point.sub(constant)`

to this:

`point = point.div(constant)`

This will _divide_ each point on the plane by `constant` before turning it into a color. And if you run the page, you should see the plane rotate and scale with the mouse:

![Rotating and scaling the complex plane](/img/julia_fractal_multiply.gif)

This way of thinking about complex numbers—where add/subtract moves a point, and multiply/divide rotates and scales it—is _incredibly_ powerful.

Let's make one more change, to show off an important function called `math.abs`. The **Absolute Value** of a complex number is its "length"—the distance from that point on the complex plane to 0+0i.

Try changing your `pointToColor` function like so:

```javascript
// constant + the rest of your script...

// Turn a point on the complex plane into a color
function pointToColor(point) {
  point = point.div(constant)

  var red = point.re * 255
  var green = point.im * 255
  var blue = math.abs(point) * 255

  return `rgb(${red}, ${green}, ${blue})`
}

// pixelToPoint + the rest of your script...
```

Now we have a `blue` value for our color, which shows `math.abs(point)`. If you run the page, it should look like this:

![Moving colors on the complex plane](/img/julia_fractal_abs.gif)

Think about the colors you see—why _these_ colors? Why is the blue in a circle? Why is one corner white?

Your script should now look like [this](https://repl.it/@polytrope/julia-fractals-drawing-plane):

```html
<script>
  // The HTML elements we are using
  var header = document.querySelector('h2')
  var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

  // The size of our canvas
  var width = 200
  var height = 200

  // Set the size of our canvas
  canvas.width = width
  canvas.height = height

  // The XY coordinates of the mouse over the canvas
  var mouseX = 0
  var mouseY = 0

  // The point we use for C in our Julia Set equation
  var constant = math.complex(0.28, 0.01)

  // Turn a point on the complex plane into a color
  function pointToColor(point) {
    point = point.sub(constant)

    var red = point.re * 255
    var green = point.im * 255
    var blue = math.abs(point) * 255

    return `rgb(${red}, ${green}, ${blue})`
  }

  // Turn XY pixel coordinates into a point on the complex plane
  function pixelToPoint(x, y) {
    // Map percentage of total width/height to a value from -1 to +1
    var zx = (x / width) * 2 - 1
    var zy = 1 - (y / height) * 2

    // Create a complex number based on our new XY values
    return math.complex(zx, zy)
  }

  // Draw a single pixel on our canvas
  function drawPixel(x, y, color) {
    ctx.fillStyle = color
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1)
  }

  // Redraw our canvas
  function draw() {
    // Loop over every column of pixels
    for (var y = 0; y < height; y++) {
      // Loop over every row of pixels
      for (var x = 0; x < width; x++) {
        // Turn this pixel into a point in the complex plane
        var point = pixelToPoint(x, y)

        // Turn that point into a color
        var color = pointToColor(point)

        // Draw over this pixel with that color
        drawPixel(x, y, color)
      }
    }
  }

  // Update the elements that need to change
  function update() {
    header.innerHTML = constant.toString()
    draw()
  }

  // What to do when the mouse moves over the canvas
  function move(event) {
    // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
    mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
    mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

    // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
    constant = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

    // Round that point off to the nearest 0.01
    constant.re = math.round(constant.re * 100) / 100
    constant.im = math.round(constant.im * 100) / 100

    // Update everything!
    update()
  }

  // Trigger move every time the mouse moves over canvas
  canvas.addEventListener('pointermove', move)

  // Update everything!
  update()
</script>
```

## The Julia Set

Now for the main event—rendering a fractal.

We're going to render the Julia Set. This fractal is defined by a very simple function:

![The equation that defines the Julia Set](/img/julia_fractal_equation.png)

We need to use this equation to generate a color for each point on the complex plane. However, this function doesn't give you a color directly—it defines a _process_ that you can apply to each point:

1. _Multiply_ that point by itself
2. _Add_ your `constant` value C
3. Repeat
   1. Multiply this _new_ point by itself
   2. Add your `constant` value C
   3. Repeat
      1. Multiply _this_ new point by itself
      2. Add your `constant` value C
      3. Repeat…

You can apply this process _infinitely_ for any point. For most points, the number will just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. When this happens, we say the number **Escapes**.

Any point with an absolute value of at least 2 will _always_ get bigger and bigger forever. So if `math.abs(z) >= 2`, we _know_ that `z` escapes.

But for some numbers in that little circle around the origin—where `math.abs(z) < 2`—something peculiar happens. Each time we apply this process, the point will move… but it will never _escape_. It may just bounce around _forever_, rotating and moving around the origin without ever "escaping" it.

To get a color from each point, we apply this process a bunch of times to see if that point escapes. We stop when `math.abs(z) > 2`, or when we hit some maximum number of iterations (we'll set a max of 64).

Add a new value called `maxIterations` just below `constant`, and a new function called `julia` just after that:

```javascript
// constant + the rest of your script...

// The maximum number of times we iterate a point to see if it escapes
var maxIterations = 64

// Apply the Julia Set formula to see if point z "escapes"
function julia(z, i = 0) {
  // Apply the Julia Set formula: z*z+constant
  z = z.mul(z)
  z = z.add(constant)

  // Has our point escaped, or hit the iteration limit?
  if (math.abs(z) > 2 || i == maxIterations)
    // If so, return number of iterations
    return i
  // If not, iterate again!
  else return julia(z, i + 1)
}

// pointToColor + the rest of your script...
```

Now we have a function `julia` which tells us how many iterations of the Julia Set equation it takes for a given point to escape.

We need to turn that number of iterations into a color. We'll use a simple grayscale color scheme, where black is 0 iterations and white is our `maxIterations` value.

Change your `pointToColor` function like so:

```javascript
// julia + the rest of your script...

// Turn a point on the complex plane into a color
function pointToColor(point) {
  // How many iterations on this point before it escapes?
  var iterations = julia(point)

  // What percentage of our limit is that?
  var percentage = iterations / maxIterations

  var red = percentage * 255
  var green = percentage * 255
  var blue = percentage * 255

  // Create a color from that percentage
  return `rgb(${red}, ${green}, ${blue})`
}

// pixelToPoint + the rest of your script...
```

Now if your run your page, you should see a grayscale Julia fractal that morphs as your move the mouse:

    // Has our point escaped, or hit the iteration limit?

    mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

    // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
    constant = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

    // Round that point off to the nearest 0.01
    constant.re = math.round(constant.re * 100) / 100
    constant.im = math.round(constant.im * 100) / 100

    // Update everything!
    update()
  }

  // Trigger move every time the mouse moves over canvas
  canvas.addEventListener('pointermove', move)

  // Update everything!
  update()
</script>
```

## Pan

Now we have a fractal, which is pretty cool. But what if we want to move around _within_ our fractal?

Let's start with a "pan" operation, that moves the image up/down/left/right as we click.

We'll set this up so that the first click sets our `constant` value, and every click after that pans the image.

Add two new values for `clicked` and `pan` at the top, just below `maxIterations` and above `julia`:

```javascript
// maxIterations + the rest of your script...

// Whether we have clicked yet
var clicked = false

// How much we move the image
var pan = math.complex(0, 0)

// julia + the rest of your script...
```

Now add a new function called `click`, just after `update`:

```javascript
// update + the rest of your script...

function click(event) {
  // Ignore the first click
  if (!clicked) {
    clicked = true
    return
  }

  // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
  mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
  mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

  // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
  pan = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

  // Update everything!
  update()
}

// the rest of your script...
```

Notice that if `clicked` is false, `click` will do nothing—except set `clicked` to true.

Similarly, we need to change `move` so that it will do nothing if `clicked` is _true_:

```javascript
// click + the rest of your script...

// What to do when the mouse moves over the canvas
function move(event) {
  // Don't move after first click
  if (clicked) {
    return
  }

  // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
  mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
  mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

  // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
  constant = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

  // Round that point off to the nearest 0.01
  constant.re = math.round(constant.re * 100) / 100
  constant.im = math.round(constant.im * 100) / 100

  // Update everything!
  update()
}
```

We also need to add a listener to trigger `click` whenever we click on the canvas. Let's put it just after our `move` function:

```javascript
// move + the rest of your script...

// Trigger click every time the canvas is clicked
canvas.addEventListener('click', click)

// the rest of your script...
```

Now when we click on the canvas, it will fix our `constant` value—and every click after that will change the `pan` value.

Finally, we need to actually _use_ that `pan` value somewhere.

We want `pan` to change which pixel maps to each point—so we need to change our `pixelToPoint` function so that our `pan` value is _added_ to each point:

```javascript
// pointToColor + the rest of your script...

// Turn XY pixel coordinates into a point on the complex plane
function pixelToPoint(x, y) {
  // Map percentage of total width/height to a value from -1 to +1
  var zx = (x / width) * 2 - 1
  var zy = 1 - (y / height) * 2

  // Create a complex number based on our new XY values
  var z = math.complex(zx, zy)

  // Pan the camera
  z = z.add(pan)

  return z
}

// drawPixel + the rest of your script...
```

Now if you run the page, you should be able to set the `constant` value and pan around the image by clicking!

Your full script should look like [this](https://repl.it/@polytrope/julia-fractals-click-pan):

```html
<script>
  // The HTML elements we are using
  var header = document.querySelector('h2')
  var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

  // The size of our canvas
  var width = 200
  var height = 200

  // Set the size of our canvas
  canvas.width = width
  canvas.height = height

  // The XY coordinates of the mouse over the canvas
  var mouseX = 0
  var mouseY = 0

  // The point we use for C in our Julia Set equation
  var constant = math.complex(0.28, 0.01)

  // The maximum number of times we iterate a point to see if it escapes
  var maxIterations = 64

  // Whether we have clicked yet
  var clicked = false

  // How much we move the image
  var pan = math.complex(0, 0)

  // Apply the Julia Set formula to see if point z "escapes"
  function julia(z, i = 0) {
    // Apply the Julia Set formula: z*z+constant
    z = z.mul(z)
    z = z.add(constant)

    // Has our point escaped, or hit the iteration limit?
    if (math.abs(z) > 2 || i == maxIterations)
      // If so, return number of iterations
      return i
    // If not, iterate again!
    else return julia(z, i + 1)
  }

  // Turn a point on the complex plane into a color
  function pointToColor(point) {
    // How many iterations on this point before it escapes?
    var iterations = julia(point)

    // What percentage of our limit is that?
    var percentage = iterations / maxIterations

    var red = percentage * 255
    var green = percentage * 255
    var blue = percentage * 255

    // Create a color from that percentage
    return `rgb(${red}, ${green}, ${blue})`
  }

  // Turn XY pixel coordinates into a point on the complex plane
  function pixelToPoint(x, y) {
    // Map percentage of total width/height to a value from -1 to +1
    var zx = (x / width) * 2 - 1
    var zy = 1 - (y / height) * 2

    // Create a complex number based on our new XY values
    var z = math.complex(zx, zy)

    // Pan the camera
    z = z.add(pan)

    return z
  }

  // Draw a single pixel on our canvas
  function drawPixel(x, y, color) {
    ctx.fillStyle = color
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1)
  }

  // Redraw our canvas
  function draw() {
    // Loop over every column of pixels
    for (var y = 0; y < height; y++) {
      // Loop over every row of pixels
      for (var x = 0; x < width; x++) {
        // Turn this pixel into a point in the complex plane
        var point = pixelToPoint(x, y)

        // Turn that point into a color
        var color = pointToColor(point)

        // Draw over this pixel with that color
        drawPixel(x, y, color)
      }
    }
  }

  // Update the elements that need to change
  function update() {
    header.innerHTML = constant.toString()
    draw()
  }

  function click(event) {
    // Ignore the first click
    if (!clicked) {
      clicked = true
      return
    }

    // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
    mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
    mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

    // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
    pan = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

    // Update everything!
    update()
  }

  // What to do when the mouse moves over the canvas
  function move(event) {
    // Don't move after first click
    if (clicked) {
      return
    }

    // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
    mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
    mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

    // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
    constant = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

    // Round that point off to the nearest 0.01
    constant.re = math.round(constant.re * 100) / 100
    constant.im = math.round(constant.im * 100) / 100

    // Update everything!
    update()
  }

  // Trigger click every time the canvas is clicked
  canvas.addEventListener('click', click)

  // Trigger move every time the mouse moves over canvas
  canvas.addEventListener('pointermove', move)

  // Update everything!
  update()
</script>
```

## Zoom

Almost done here… all we need now is a zoom feature.

Add a new variable for `zoom`, just after `pan`:

```javascript
// pan + the rest of your script...

// How much we zoom the image
var zoom = 1

// julia + the rest of your script...
```

Let's make it so every click _doubles_ the zoom value.

We just need to add one new line to our `click` function for `zoom *= 2`:

```javascript
// update + the rest of your script...

// What to do when the mouse clicks the canvas
function click(event) {
  // Ignore the first click
  if (!clicked) {
    clicked = true
    return
  }

  // Get the mouse's XY coordinates on canvas
  mouseX = event.clientX - canvas.offsetLeft
  mouseY = event.clientY - canvas.offsetTop

  // Turn mouse coordinates into a point on the complex plane
  pan = pixelToPoint(mouseX, mouseY)

  // Zoom in twice as far
  zoom *= 2

  // Update everything!
  update()
}

// move + the rest of your script...
```

Now we need to change our `pixelToPoint` function to use that `zoom` value. Like `pan`, this is pretty simple—we just need to _divide_ each point by `zoom`, just before we add `pan`:

```javascript
// pointToColor + the rest of your script...

// Turn XY pixel coordinates into a point on the complex plane
function pixelToPoint(x, y) {
  // Map percentage of total width/height to a value from -1 to +1
  var zx = (x / width) * 2 - 1
  var zy = 1 - (y / height) * 2

  // Create a complex number based on our new XY values
  var z = math.complex(zx, zy)

  // Zoom the camera
  z = z.div(zoom)

  // Pan the camera
  z = z.add(pan)

  return z
}

// drawPixel + the rest of your script...
```

Finally, let's make one last change to our `update` function so that it will tell us how far we have zoomed in:

```javascript
// draw + the rest of your script...

// Update the elements that need to change
function update() {
  header.innerHTML = constant.toString() + ' at ' + zoom + 'X'
  draw()
}

// click + the rest of your script...
```

Now if you run the page, you should be able to zoom in on the image with every click!

Your final script should look like [this](https://repl.it/@polytrope/julia-fractals-click-zoom):

```html
<script>

  var header = document.querySelector('h2')
  var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')

  var height = 200

  // Set the size of our canvas
  canvas.width = width
  canvas.height = height

  // The XY coordinates of the mouse over the canvas
  var mouseX = 0
  var mouseY = 0

  // The point we use for C in our Julia Set equation
  var constant = math.complex(0.28, 0.01)

  // The maximum number of times we iterate a point to see if it escapes
  var maxIterations = 64

  // Whether we have clicked yet
  var clicked = false

  // How much we move the image
  var pan = math.complex(0, 0)

  // How much we zoom the image
  var zoom = 1

  // Apply the Julia Set formula to see if point z "escapes"
  function julia(z, i = 0) {
    // Apply the Julia Set formula: z*z+constant
    z = z.mul(z)
    z = z.add(constant)

    // Has our point escaped, or hit the iteration limit?
    if (math.abs(z) > 2 || i == maxIterations)
      // If so, return number of iterations
      return i
    // If not, iterate again!
    else return julia(z, i + 1)
  }

  // Turn a point on the complex plane into a color
  function pointToColor(point) {
    // How many iterations on this point before it escapes?

    var percentage = iterations / maxIterations

    var red = percentage * 255
    var green = percentage * 255
    var blue = percentage * 255

    // Create a color from that percentage
    return `rgb(${red}, ${green}, ${blue})`
  }

## Epilogue

There are all kinds of fractals.

You can make [fractal trees](https://hackclub.com/workshops/tree_machine):

![An animated fractal tree](/img/fractal_tree.gif)

Or how about some [3D fractals](http://www.mandelbulb.com/):

![The Mandelbulb 3D fractal](/img/mandelbulb.jpg)

You can even grow [broccoli with fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesco_broccoli) (yes this is real broccoli that you can buy at some supermarkets):

![An image of romanesco broccoli](/img/fractal_broccoli.jpg)

But fractals are just the beginning of what you can do with complex numbers. Complex numbers are _essential_ to everything from quantum physics to guitar amplifiers.

Pretty remarkable for such a simple idea.
