#### **What is Raspberry Pi?**

Raspberry Pi is an extremely sleek and tiny computer. It is about the size of a normal credit card and runs on Linux based operating system. This board can be thought of as a miniaturized version of the motherboard in your CPU. It might not offer the same powerful processing capabilities as a normal PC, but it gets the job done.

The Raspberry Pi is a full computer. It has a processor, graphics processor, and memory, just like a normal computer or laptop â€“ itâ€™s just a lot smaller. The Raspberry Pi can be used in any situation a computer could be used. This can be as simple as being used as your desktop computer. Other people use them as mini servers in their house, as media computers for their TV, or as tiny computers to power their fun projects. It could be the brains of a robot, control a vegetable garden, or even just blink a light. The Raspberry Pi can be manipulated to control and read electronic components using its GPIO pins by using python programming. The possibilities with Raspberry Pi are limited only by your imagination.

Just like how you need to hook up your CPU to a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and LAN. The Raspberry Pi also offers USB ports for interfacing keyboard and mouse, an HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) port to connect a monitor/TV, 3.5mm audio jack with composite video output for using with old RCA television, Camera connector, display connector and an Ethernet port to gain internet access. It also has inbuilt Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

The Raspberry Pi is powered by a 5v power supply. Just like you have a hard disk on normal computers, the raspberry pi uses an SD card that acts as the hard disk. The OS is loaded onto the SD card and plugged into the board. You can use various memory capacity SD cards: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, etc.

Main attraction of Raspberry Pi compared to our normal PC is the availability of 40 GPIO pins.

#### **Story of Raspberry pi**

The Raspberry Pi came alive when the Raspberry Pi foundation based in UK thought of launching a cheap single-board computer to promote the learning of computer science in schools. But it became so popular that the Raspberry Pi was adopted by hobbyists and engineers. Raspberry Piâ€™s are often used to prototype IoT devices, entertainment equipmentâ€™s and robotics. One of the main reason for the growth of the Raspberry Pi, is its community support and resources.

As of now the Raspberry Pi foundation has sold more than 11 million Piâ€™s. Even the International Space Station have two Raspberry Pi's :)

## Which model of Raspberry Pi should I buy?

> Raspberry Pi 3 vs Pi zero W

So you have finally settled on to use a Raspberry Pi for your next project. But which model of Raspberry Pi should a beginner buy?

#### Raspberry Pi 3

Raspberry Pi 3 is the top end, Raspberry Pi available now. Packs in more power and capabilities compared to its predecessors. Has 4 USB ports, enough to connect all your peripherals. Ethernet port for wired internet connection. A normal HDMI port. 3.5mm audio/video composite out for audio and analogue video signal. 

All you need to do is to plug in all the cables you have lying around in your house no need to buy extra cables to make it work.

#### Pi Zero W

Pi zero W costs only $10 compared to the $35 price tag of the Raspberry Pi 3 and is capable of doing all the functions a normal Raspberry Pi can do. Except for the lack of 3 USB ports, Ethernet port, in-built audio out and processing power. 

The small size of Pi zero W makes it ideal for use in embedded projects. It packs in a decent amount of processing power delivered by the single core processor clocked at 1GHz. 

#### Verdict

Even though the Pi zero W costs less and has a decent performance the additional requirements like Mini HDMI converter, OTG cable, Mini camera cable and the need of USB hub makes it more or less cost up to $25 to fully function. In my opinion, beginners should consider buying the Raspberry Pi 3 as it is easy to use out of the box and has plenty of ports to connect your peripherals. Most of all the model should suit your project. If you are planning to make a project that has a low profile you should definitely consider the Pi zero W. 

In the end, it is your decision that matters. Decide what purpose you are gonna use your Raspberry Pi and arrive at a conclusion.

## Simple IoT project with Raspberry Pi & Cayenne

Raspberry Pi with its new models has become an integral part of IoT projects. 

By IoT, it means a device connected to the internet that can be controlled and monitored through the internet. In this project, we are going to use a "drag and drop" IoT project builder platform known as [Cayenne](http://cayenne.mydevices.com). With this platform, we can read sensor data, control actuators etc. 

As a beginner step to the IoT project, we are going to control an LED using the Cayenne app (Cayenne can also be used through your PC's browser)

### Things Needed

- Raspberry Pi connected to the internet
- Breadboard
- An LED
- 220ohm resistor
- Female to male jumper wires

Turn on your Raspberry Pi and connect to your network.

Then download the Cayenne app from [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mydevices.cayenne&hl=en) or use their [website](http://cayenne.mydevices.com).
