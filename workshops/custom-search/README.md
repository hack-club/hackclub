# Custom Search

Let's use Google to build Google. In this workshop, we're going to use Google's Search API to fetch queries and output the most relevant topics! Here's what the final product will look like (I highly encourage you to customize it to make it your own!)

![Demo](img/demo.png)

To build this product, we're going to need:
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS

We'll also be delving into Google APIs, so make sure that you have an account set up! We're going to build this product on [repl.it](https://replit.com) because it sets up automatic deployments right from your web browser. 

## Get Started

Head on over to the [Replit Starter](https://replit.com/@rajnagrwl/search-starter) for this project and click **fork** in the top right corner. This will give you access to the styles and preliminary code to get you started!

Once this is ready, head on over to the `index.html` file and add the following inbetween the `<body></body>` tags:

```html
<img src="moogle.png" width="525" class="image">
    <div class="search">
      <input type="text" id="search" class="input">
      <button id="submit" class="searchbtn" onclick="submit()">Search</button>
    </div>
		<div style="height: 300px;"></div>
    <div id="buttons" class="buttons">
      <button id="allbutton" class="all" onclick="submit()"></button>
    </div>
    <div id="content"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <script id="query" src="query.js"></script>
```

Let's break this down. First, we are adding the image via the `img` tag at the very top of the page. Then, we are adding an `input` and `button` to add a query for our search engine to interpret. Adding `onclick="submit()` let's our Javascript know to run that function when clicked! Next, we have a filter for all of our searches to appear at once. This content will then appear in the `<div id="content"></div>` tag. Finally, we are referencing our `script.js` and `query.js` files. Once completed, click 'Run' at the top of your screen and you should see the following screen.

## The Google API

Awesomeâ€”the interface is complete! Now let's fetch some queries. In your `query.js` file, you should see a function that calls `submit()`. Within that function, paste the following code:

```javascript
  document.getElementById('buttons').style.display = 'block';
  document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = '';
  var val = document.getElementById('search').value;
  var newelement = document.createElement('script');
  newelement.src = `https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=API_KEY&cx=003606982592251140240:5xbiwoxb3m0&q=${val}&callback=hndlr`;
  newelement.id = 'mainscript';
  document.body.appendChild(newelement);

```

Now, we need to set up the Google Search API! To get started, head on over to [Google's Developer Portal](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) and make sure that you are logged in. Once complete, scroll down to `Get a Key` and create a project called `Search`. Once you click `next`, copy your API key and click `Done`. In your query.js file, you will see a variable called `newelement.src`. Where it says `API_KEY`, paste in your API Key and you're good to go!

*Disclaimer: The Google Search API provides 100 search queries per day for free. Additional requests cost $5 per 1000 queries. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction/?apix=true)*

![Portal](img/portal.png)

You're probably wondering what that really long URL is! Essentially, it calls JSON data for any query. `https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?` lets us know that we are using the Custom Search API. Next, `key=API_KEY` calls the API Key associated with your account! (Don't share this with anyone) The `cx` key associates any searches with a search engine Id. `q=${val}` calls any query or search and `callback=hndlr` is used as a parameter that is called after the function is executed. 

## Formatting Query Results

Now that this is completed, let's format our content. Head over to the `script.js` file and you should see a function called `hdnlr(response)`. Inside this function, add the following code:

```javascript
try {
    document.getElementById('content').innerHTML += `<div style="color: grey;">Holy Moly! About ${response.searchInformation.formattedTotalResults} results in ${response.searchInformation.formattedSearchTime} seconds!</div>`
    for (var i = 0; i < response.items.length; i++) {
      document.getElementById('content').innerHTML += `<div style="align-items: center;"><br><a style="color: grey; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none;" href=${response.items[i].link} target="_blank">${response.items[i].link}</a><a target="_blank" href=${response.items[i].link} style="text-decoration: none;"><h2 style="margin-top: 2px;">${response.items[i].title}</h2></a><div style="margin-top: -8px;">${response.items[i].htmlSnippet}</div></div>`;
    }
  } catch(error) {
    document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = 'error!';
  }

```

Within the `try` function, we call important data about your search query. By using `document.getElementById('content').innerHTML`, we call the `<div id="content"></div>` and correspond the styled data with it. From the Google Search API, we can call functions like `formattedTotalResults`, `formattedSearchTime`, `link`, `title` and `htmlSnippet`. If there is an error with the API, the content will just return "error!".

## Magic Time!

And that's it! If you click run and head to your replit link, you should see a full functional search engine at your service! Here's a link to [the final code](https://github.com/rajanwastaken/custom-search) (excluding the API key) if you need any help!

## Next Steps

A few key things to note:
- Please do not share your API Key with anyone!
- Do not exceed 100 queries per day (i'm still working on a web scraper for unlimited queries)

I highly encourage you all to customize this however you want! If CSS is your jam, be sure to send me a cool search engine that you came up with! Be sure to #ship your favourite creations, and share how you just built the next Google.

Happy Hacking!
