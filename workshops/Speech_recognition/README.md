*Note: This workshop only works for Google Chrome at the moment. You'll also need a computer that has a microphone.*

## Setup

This workshop requires a very basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. Donâ€™t worry if you get stuck at some point in the workshop, everything is explained the best way for you to understand!

For this workshop we will use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/), a free, online code editor. Click [here](https://repl.it/languages/html) to get started with a new HTML project on repl.it.

![Setup](https://cloud-qbmylslty.vercel.app/0image.png)

## HTML

When your repl spins up, you should be automatically dumped into the `index.html` file. If you don't, navigate to that file in the sidebar on the left.

The first thing we need to do is create a `div` container with the class `main-container` with 2 more `div` elements inside. The first `div` container will have 3 `button` elements in, and the second one will have a `textarea` element. Put all of this in between the `<body>` `</body>` tags.

Here's what your HTML body will look like once you've done this:

``` html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div>
      <button id="btnStartRecord">START</button>
      <button id="btnStopRecord">STOP</button>
      <button id="playText">PLAY</button>
    </div>

    <div>
      <textarea id="text" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
    </div>
  </div>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

- Using the `<div>` tag, we are creating a container, in which the `START`, `STOP` and `PLAY` buttons are going to be in.
- Each button will have an `id` that will let us work with our buttons later in JavaScript. 
- We are creating a `<textarea>` element, in which all the text will be in.
- The `<script>` element is linking our JavaScript file with our HTML document.   

This is the result of the code above:

![HTML](https://cloud-hz3x1xvwh.vercel.app/0image.png)

Nice! This is all the HTML we need to write. Now, let's add some styling.

## CSS

Navigate to the `style.css` file.

First, we'll give to our website a background color:

```css
body {
  background: #c5c5c5;
}
```

Then, we want to center the `main-container` vertically and horizontally on the page.

```css
.main-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

Let's break this down:
- The `display` property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.
- The `flex-direction` property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed).
- The `justify-content` defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.
- The `align-items` property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group.

Here's how our website looks so far:

![CSS Result 1](https://cloud-383ylgdfq.vercel.app/0image.png)

And finally, we'll style the `button` and `textarea` elements.

```css
button {
  background-color: #34495E;
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 8px 20px;
  margin: 0 3px 5px 0;
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 2px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

#text {
  border: 2px #34495E solid;
  border-radius: 2px;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

Let's break this down:

- The `background-color`, `color` and `font-size` properties give the buttons a background color, a color to the text and a size to the text respectively.
- The `padding` and `margin` properties are part of the [CSS box model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp).
- The `border` and `border-radius` allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border and define the radius of the element's corners respectively.
- The `cursor` property sets the type of mouse cursor, if any, to show when the mouse pointer is over the buttons.
- The `overflow-y` property sets what shows when content overflows a block-level element's top and bottom edges. This may be nothing, a scroll bar, or the overflow content.

Finally, this is how our website looks like:

## JavaScript

Now that we've styled our page, let's write some JavaScript! Navigate to the `script.js` file.

First, we'll need to take the buttons from our HTML document and then assign them to the following variables:

```js
const btnStartRecord = document.getElementById('btnStartRecord');
const btnStopRecord = document.getElementById('btnStopRecord');
const btnPlayText = document.getElementById('playText');  
const text = document.getElementById('text');
```

Let's break this down:
- Using the method `document.getElementById()`, we are getting the elements in the document that have the corresponding IDs.
- We are holding those elements that we got in [constant](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_const.asp) variables.
    
The next thing to do is define a speech recognition instance to control the recognition for our applicationn. To do this, we'll use the `webkitSpeechRecognition()` constructor.

```js
let recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
```

Now we can control the way the speech recognition constructor works:

```js
recognition.lang =â€˜en-USâ€™
recognition.continuous = true;
recognition.interimResults = false;    
```

- `recognition.lang` is used to set a language for the speech recognition. [Here](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm), you can find a table that contains language codes.
- `recognition.continuous` is used to define whether the microphone records continuous or not.
- `recognition.interimResults` is used to define if the speech recognition shows the results immediately or once the speech recognition recognize an entire sentence. We can leave it as false, because it's more precise.
    
The next thing we want to do is return the results that the speech recognition app got:

```js
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const results = event.results;
  const sentence = results[results.length - 1][0].transcript;
  text.value += sentence;
} 
```

- The `onresult` property of the SpeechRecognition interface represents an event handler that will run when the speech recognition service returns a result â€” a word or phrase has been positively recognized and this has been communicated back to the app.
- The `results` variable contains the returned values, it has a getter so it can be accessed like an array.
- The `sentence` variable takes the `result` variable and access the items [result.length - 1] and [0], and then it transcripts those items.
- Finally, `text.value += sentence;` gets the value of the element text and then using the assignment operator `+=`, we add the gotten result to the current text.

Now, we'll create an event that shows a message when the speech recognition ends.

```js
recognition.onend = (event) => {
  console.log('the microphone stops listening');
}
```

- The `console.log` is a function that writes a message to **log** on the debugging **console**
- `recognition.onend` is an event that runs certain code when the speech recognition ends.

And we'll create another event that shows us when an error occurs.

```js
recognition.onerror = (event) => {
  console.log(event.error)
}
```

- `recognition.onerror` runs certain code when an error occurs.
- `console.log (event.error)` writes in the console the occurred error.

Now, we'll make the buttons work when they are clicked.

```js
btnStartRecord.addEventListener('click', () => {
  recognition.start();
});
btnStopRecord.addEventListener('click', () => {
  recognition.abort();
});
btnPlayText.addEventListener('click', () => {
  readText(text.value);
});
```

- The method **`addEventListener()`** sets up a function that will be called whenever the `click` event is delivered to the buttons.
- The `recognition.start()` event starts the speech recognition app.
- The `recognition.abort();` even stops the speech recognition app.
- In the third event listener we are calling the function `readText()` that we'll create.

The last thing we'll do is to create a function that reads the text gotten from the speech recognition app.

```js
function readText(text) {
  const speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();
  speech.text = text;
  speech.volume = 1;
  speech.rate = 1;
  speech.pitch = 1;
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
}
```

Let's break this down:

- First we are creating an object called `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`. It contains the content the speech service should read and information about how to read it.
- `speech.text` defines which text is going to be read, in this case it will be the text inside of the `<textarea>` element in our document.
- The property `speech.volume` of the interface gets and sets the volume that the utterance will be spoken at
- The `speech.rate` property of the interface gets and sets the speed at which the utterance will be spoken at.
- The `speech.pitch` property of the interface gets and sets the pitch at which the utterance will be spoken at.
- This line of code `window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);` makes the speech synthesis start speaking.

### Running the program

Alright, let's test it out! Click the green "Run" button at the top of your repl to run the program. I recommend opening the preview in a new tab. If all goes well, Google Chrome will prompt you to allow microphone access. Give it access to your microphone. Then, speak into your computer!

If it doesn't work, go through your code line by line and try to see if you can find what went wrong. If you're stuck, ask your club leader.

<summary>Here's the final JavaScript code:</summary>

```js
const btnStartRecord = document.getElementById('btnStartRecord');
const btnStopRecord = document.getElementById('btnStopRecord');
const btnPlayText = document.getElementById('playText');
const text = document.getElementById('text');

let recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.lang ='en-EN'
recognition.continuous = true;
recognition.interimResults = false;

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const results = event.results;
  const sentence = results[results.length - 1] [0].transcript;
  text.value += sentence;
}

recognition.onend = (event) => {
  console.log('the microphone stops listening');
}

recognition.onerror = (event) => {
  console.log(event.error)
}

btnStartRecord.addEventListener('click',() => {
  recognition.start();
});

btnStopRecord.addEventListener('click',() => {
  recognition.abort();
})

btnPlayText.addEventListener('click',() => {
  readText(text.value);
});

function readText(text) {
  const speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();
  speech.text = text;
  speech.volume = 1;
  speech.rate = 1;
  speech.pitch = 1;

  window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
}
```

## Hack it
Yay! you made it to the end of this workshop. I know this was a pretty simple workshop, but you can still make pretty complex stuff... Let me give you some ideas:

- Use [if statatements](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp) to do certaing thing when the speech recognition app returns text.
- Create an app that play, stop and skip songs.
- Style your app to make it look cool.

Here are some demos made by other people:

- [An app that takes you to certaing link depending on the word said.](https://codepen.io/Rumyra/pen/bCphe)
- [Phrase matcher app](https://mdn.github.io/web-speech-api/phrase-matcher/)
- [This demo changes the background color of the website when a color is recognized](https://mdn.github.io/web-speech-api/speech-color-changer/)
