Here's the [live demo][final_live_demo] and [final code][final_code]

[final_live_demo]: https://js-css-clock.faisalsayed1.repl.co/
[final_code]: https://repl.it/@FaisalSayed1/JS-CSS-Clock
[repl_it]: https://repl.it

## Part I: Prerequisites
You should have a beginner understanding of:
#### - HTML
#### - CSS
#### - JAVASCRIPT

## Part II: Setup

### Setting up your code environment on Repl.it

[Repl.it](https://repl.it) is an online code editor where you will build your clock today.

To get started, go to [https://repl.it/languages/html](https://repl.it/languages/html). Your coding environment will spin up in just a few seconds!

This is what it looks like:

## Part III: Inspecting The Default Files

![Image](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7bufkPz3LRof205G/giphy.gif)

### 1) The HTML file
Let us first take a look at the HTML file (`index.html`) present in your repl.

At line 1 we have `<!DOCTYPE html>` This declares that this file is a HTML file.  
If we take a look in the `<html>` tag, we will find a `<body>` tag. Here's where we will write the code. Make sure that all the code you write is included between the opening and closing body tags. (`<body></body>`)

### 2) The CSS file

This is the `style.css` file in your directory. Whatever styles we give to our website is written in this file.  
Make sure you have imported this file in your main HTML file (`index.html`).  
If you take a look in the `<head>` tag in your html, you will find a line of code similar to this.  
`<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />`
This means that your CSS file is properly linked to your HTML file!

### 3) The Javascript file

This is the `script.js` file in your directory. Its empty for now, but we will fill it eventually through the workshop!  
Also, this is the most important file for our today's workshop. The code written here will be responsible for the functioning of our Clock.  
Make sure you have linked this file too in your HTML.  
If you take a look in the `<body>` tag, you'll find:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
This means that your Javascript file is linked to your HTML.

## Part IV: Building the Clock

### 1) HTML

Lets start building our clock! First let's write the HTML code required.  
Inside of our `<body>` tag, add a `<div>` tag with "Hello World!" in it.  
Let's see if we wrote our code correctly. On the top of your website, you'll see a **RUN** Button. Click on it and see the Magic Happen! If you see "Hello World!" printed on your screen, you are going the right way!  

This is your code so far.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>repl.it</title>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <div>Hello World</div> <!-- Adding a div tag -->
  </body>
</html>
```

We don't really need the 'Hello World' right? Let's remove it.  
Add a class "clock" to your `<div>` tag. Now we need to nest some more div tags inside it. Add another `<div>` tag inside of your existing `<div>` and give it a class of "clock-face". Let's add 3 more `<div>` tags nested inside of the "clock-face" div.  

Note: Don't nest these 3 tags in themselves.  

Give a class of "hand hour-hand", "hand min-hand", "hand second-hand" to each of the 3 new `<div>` tags respectively.  
Note: Make sure the `<script>` tag, which is in your body, is below the `<div>` tags or else it will throw you errors.  

This is your code so far:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
	<title>repl.it</title>
	<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>

<body>
    <div class="clock">
      <div class="clock-face">
      <!-- Nesting the Div -->
        <div class="hand hour-hand"></div>
        <div class="hand min-hand"></div>
        <div class="hand second-hand"></div>
      <!-- Nesting the Div -->
      </div>
    </div>
	<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

And that's it! Yes really! We have completed writing our HTML.

### 2) CSS

After we have done writing our HTML, it doesn't really show up on your browser screen. Your browser screen is blank!  
Let's now add some stylings to our `<div>` tags!  

Go to `style.css` in your repl.it directory. Let's start by adding some styles to our body! uhh... I meant `<body>`!  

Add the following code to your CSS:

```css
      body {
        background: #01ed7f;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        min-height: 100vh;
      }
```

**Explanation:**
3 Main steps in writing CSS:
1. Select the tag / class / id on which you want to apply your styles.
2. Open Curly Brackets `{}`.
3. Start adding your styles inside the curly brackets!

We start by giving our website a soothing green color. Go ahead and try changing it to the color of your own choice!  
Then we removed the default margin and padding from all the elements in our website. We changed the default display `(display: block)` to `(display: flex)`. A very good reason for this is because `flex` enables you to align your items perfectly to the center! And that's what we have done in the next two lines. The `align-items` property aligns all your children elements to center, but horizontally. The `justify-content` property aligns all your children elements to center, but vertically. Next we have the `min-height` property which sets a minimum height of 100vh (Viewport Height) to your `<body>`.  

Next, we'll need to add some styles to our clock!  
Following the 3 main steps given above, let's accomplish this task!  
1. Select the class designated to the clock div.

2. Open Curly Brackets to write the stylings.  

![Image](https://cloud-b7yg1ciea.vercel.app/image.png)

3. Add the following styles to this class. 

```css
.clock {
    width: 25rem;
    height: 25rem;
    border: 20px solid whitesmoke;
    border-radius: 50px;
    background: blanchedalmond;
    background-image: url(https://bit.ly/2RcERUw);
    background-size: cover;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
				inset 0 0 0 3px #efefef,
          		inset 0 0 10px black,
				0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
			}
```

**Explanation**:
We gave a width and a height to our clock. Next, we gave it a border and the radius for the border. Next, is the background color for that clock (if you don't like it, consider changing it or even removing it). Similarly, there's a background image which is the face of the clock. we need to add `background-size: cover;` property, in order to show our image properly on the website screen. Also, we have added some shadows to the element.  

Now lets test our code! Click on the **RUN** button and Voila! Here's the basic background for our clock!  

![Image](https://cloud-dgjpl9scw.vercel.app/image.png)

Next, give a position of relative and a 100% width & 100% height to the class `.clock-face`  

Your CSS code so far:

```css
      body {
        background: #01ed7f;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        min-height: 100vh;
      }

      .clock {
		width: 25rem;
        height: 25rem;
        border: 20px solid whitesmoke;
        background: blanchedalmond;
        background-image: url(https://bit.ly/2RcERUw);
        background-size: cover;
        border-radius: 50px;
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
					inset 0 0 0 3px #efefef,
          			inset 0 0 10px black,
					0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
			}

      .clock-face {
        position: relative;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
```

Similarly, add more stylings to your CSS code:

```css
      .hand {
        background: black;
        height: 6px;
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        transform-origin: 100%;
        transform: rotate(90deg);
        transition: all 0.05s;
        transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1);
      }

      .hour-hand {
        width: 30%;
        right: 50%;
      }

      .min-hand {
        width: 35%;
        right: 50%;
      }

      .second-hand {
        width: 40%;
        right: 50%;
      }
```

**Explanation:** 
We give the clock hands, a black color. (Once again, totally upto you. Give any color of your choice)  
We specify its height and position. Next, we give it a property of `top` to `50%`, basically it aligns our clock hands in the very center of our clock. To ensure that our clock rotates properly, we give it a  `transform-origin: 100%;`.  
(Try testing by removing the transform origin property once we add Javascript later). Next we have more transition properties to animate our hands so as to give us that real clock effect!  

Note: The `.hand` class was given to 3 `<div>` tags which means this styling will affect all the 3 `<div>` tags. To give some extra classes to the Hour Hand, Minute Hand and the Second Hand specifically, we also gave those 3 `<div>` tags, a unique classname.  

To align each hand properly, we also give them a property of `right: 50%;`  

Here's what we have so far:

And that's it for the CSS. Now let's move on to the Javascript Part!

## 3) Javascript

Before Panicking, let me ensure you that there's really only 20 lines of Javascript code!

Go to your `script.js` file.  
First let us link the `<div>` tags in our HTML to javascript:  
Type the following code:  

```js
const secondHand = document.querySelector(".second-hand");
const minsHand = document.querySelector(".min-hand");
const hourHand = document.querySelector(".hour-hand");
```

**Explanation:**
We declare the variables 'secondHand', 'minsHand', 'hourHand' using 'const' and set its value to the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document. In our case, that CSS selectors are `".second-hand"` , `".min-hand"` , `".hour-hand"` respectively.  

**What is querySelector()?**
The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.

Learn more about query selector [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector).

Now its time to implement a function which will help us in the proper functioning of the clock.  
Create a function 'setDate' in your file. (You can name it anything you want)

```js
function setDate() {
}
```

We can get the current date using the `Javascript Date Object`. Let's store it in a variable:

```js
function setDate() {
 	const currentTime = new Date();
}
```
This object also contains specific methods through which you can get the current Hour / Minute / Second etc.  

Learn more on [Javascript Dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).

let's start by getting the current seconds, Add this code to the setDate function:  
```
const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
```
Now, if we want the hands to rotate, we can't simply feed the current time to it. We'll need to convert the current values into degrees and henceforth do the transition.  

Maths Time!!  

![Image](https://media.giphy.com/media/26gR0YFZxWbnUPtMA/giphy.gif)

Code:

```js
function setDate() {
    const currentTime = new Date();
    const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
	const secondDegrees = (seconds / 60) * 360 + 90;
	secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondDegrees}deg)`;
}
```
**Explanation:**
We have the current seconds stored in the `seconds` variable. We then create a new variable (`secondDegrees`) in which we convert the current seconds into degrees. In the next line, we add the transform style property to the `secondHand` which will rotate the hand according to the value of `secondDegrees`.  
Note: Here, we used backticks (``) instead of quotes (""). This is an ES6 syntax. It helps us to write variables inside of strings.  
So that line basically looks like:  
```
eg: if secondDegrees = 110;
then: secondHand.style.transform = 'rotate(110deg)'; 
```

**Challenge:** Do the same above process for fetching minutes & hours and convert them into degrees.  
**Hint:** Use the methods `getMinutes()` and `getHours()`

The code so far:

```js
function setDate() {
 	const currentTime = new Date();
	const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
	const secondDegrees = (seconds / 60) * 360 + 90;
	secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondDegrees}deg)`;

	const mins = currentTime.getMinutes();
	const minsDeg = (mins / 60) * 360 + 90;
	minsHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minsDeg}deg)`;

	const hours = currentTime.getHours();
	const hourDeg = (hours / 12) * 360 + 90;
	hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hourDeg}deg)`;
}
```

Our clock is almost finished! We now just need to call that function every second.  
For this, first we will call a `requestAnimationFrame()` function inside of our main function (`setDate()`) and pass `setDate` to `requestAnimationFrame(//pass value here)`. This will make sure our function keeps running and never stops.

```js
requestAnimationFrame(setDate)
```
Let us now try to run our code.  
Hmm... Something is wrong... Our Javascript doesn't seem to work.  
That is because we never called our function at the very first place.  
Copy the `requestAnimationFrame(setDate)` function which we called it inside of our function and paste it outside of the main function.  

**Note:** Don't remove the previous `requestAnimationFrame(setDate)`. We need to add the same line once again, but outside of the function.  

Our Javascript Code so far:

```js
const secondHand = document.querySelector(".second-hand");
const minsHand = document.querySelector(".min-hand");
const hourHand = document.querySelector(".hour-hand");

function setDate() {
 	const currentTime = new Date();
	const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
	const secondDegrees = (seconds / 60) * 360 + 90;
	secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondDegrees}deg)`;

	const mins = currentTime.getMinutes();
	const minsDeg = (mins / 60) * 360 + 90;
	minsHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minsDeg}deg)`;

	const hours = currentTime.getHours();
	const hourDeg = (hours / 12) * 360 + 90;
	hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hourDeg}deg)`;
	requestAnimationFrame(setDate);
}

requestAnimationFrame(setDate);
```

Learn more on [requestAnimationFrame()](https://css-tricks.com/using-requestanimationframe/).

Let us now try to run our code. And Voila! Our clock is ready!  
But wait, if we notice something closely, when we refresh our website, something weird happens for a milisecond.  
The quick fix for this is to call our main function before we call `requestAnimationFrame(setDate)`.  

The Final Code:

```js
const secondHand = document.querySelector(".second-hand");
const minsHand = document.querySelector(".min-hand");
const hourHand = document.querySelector(".hour-hand");

function setDate() {
 	const currentTime = new Date();
	const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
	const secondDegrees = (seconds / 60) * 360 + 90;
	secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondDegrees}deg)`;

	const mins = currentTime.getMinutes();
	const minsDeg = (mins / 60) * 360 + 90;
	minsHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minsDeg}deg)`;

	const hours = currentTime.getHours();
	const hourDeg = (hours / 12) * 360 + 90;
	hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hourDeg}deg)`;
	requestAnimationFrame(setDate);
}

setDate(); // Calling the function before requestAnimationFrame().
requestAnimationFrame(setDate);
```

**And Congratulations! You just built a clock using just 20 lines of Javascript!**  
What a beauty of Time!

## Part V: The End
If you haven't created an account on repl.it, make sure you do so to save this wonderful piece of creation!  

Here are somethings which you can do:  
1. Consider changing the colors and adding more features!  
2. Try to make the clock circular!  
3. Try to make it dark theme!
4. Try to think of more unique ideas on how you can add more features (displaying the date etc).

Now that you have finished building this wonderful clock, you should share your beautiful creation with other people! Remember, it's as easy as giving them your URL!
