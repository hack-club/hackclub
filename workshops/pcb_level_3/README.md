In this workshop we will add an accelerometer and LEDs to our microcontroller board.
3. LEDs: WS2812B or equivalent. The size is dictated by your PCB design, you could get the original 5x5mm WS2812, or 3.5x3.5mm WS2812-MINI, or 2x2mm WS2812-2020 or an equivalent clone.

Component notes:

    The grant allows you to purchase anything from one of the allowed suppliers, including JLCPCB
    One of JLCPCB's sister/partner companies, LCSC, stocks virtually every generic component you'd ever need, and all of them can be assembled
    Keep in mind that JLCPCB charges a $3 fee for every "extended component" type that they assemble
    You will not be able to get specialized components from Adafruit or similar companies through the grant
    A complete library of JLCPCB/LCSC components is available at https://jlcpcb.com/parts
