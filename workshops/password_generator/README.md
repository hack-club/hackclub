Tips ON PASSWORD GENERATION

Based on the case study

What kind of special character website supports!‚úåÔ∏è


Lengthy ‚Äì Short length passwords are relatively easy to break, so the idea is to create lengthier ones for added security and to make them less predictable. So what is the desired or required length? A 2010 Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) study told how a 12-character random password could satisfy a minimum length requirement to defeat code breaking and cracking software, said Joshua Davis, a research scientist at GTRI. Richard Boyd, a senior researcher at GTRI says, ‚ÄúEight-character passwords are insufficient now‚Ä¶ and if you restrict your characters to only alphabetic letters, it can be cracked in minutes.‚Äù In any case, to be on the safe side, a password length of 12 characters or more should be adopted.


Strong and complex ‚Äì Strong passwords are still key. Security experts agree that upper and lowercase alphanumerical characters are good practices for increasing passwords strength and making it capable of resisting guessing and brute-force attacks. In order to add complexity without compromising ease-of-use, users could modify passphrases by inserting spaces, punctuation and misspellings.

#EASY
```python
#random is used to choose a character from chars string
import random

#taking input from users about how long password to be they want
length =int(input("enter the length of the password"))

#chars variable is used to store all alphabet and numeric values
chars="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"

c=int(input("enter the number of password you want to print"))

for b in range(c):

#To start with, our password variable should be empty
 password=""



#intialize the length as the argument in for loop
 for a in range(length):

#password variable is used to store a random variable from char string and + is used to add the letter each time
  password += random.choice(chars)

#it is used print the password variable
 print(password,"\n *******")
print("Weak Password,")
