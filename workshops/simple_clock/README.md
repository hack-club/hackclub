# JavaScript Clock  

Have you ever wondered how to build a clock? Have you ever wanted to build your own clock but didn't because it was hard? Well, today I'm going to show you how to build one and you know what? It's very simple!

It will look something like this (But make sure you do add some custom CSS) :

[![homepage](https://cloud-azpvjrywa.vercel.app/image.png)](https://js-css-clock.faisalsayed1.repl.co/)

Here's the [live demo][final_live_demo] and [final code][final_code].

[final_live_demo]: https://js-css-clock.faisalsayed1.repl.co/
[final_code]: https://repl.it/@FaisalSayed1/JS-CSS-Clock
[repl_it]: https://repl.it

## Part 1: Prerequisites
You should have a beginner understanding of:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Part 2: Setup

### Setting up your code environment on Repl.it

[Repl.it](https://repl.it) is an online code editor where you can build your clock. You don't have to use Repl.it but I suggest you do as it sets everything up for you and you don't require any installations.

To get started, go to [https://repl.it/languages/html](https://repl.it/languages/html). Your coding environment will spin up in just a few seconds!

You should see something like the following:

## Part 3: Inspecting The Default Files

![Image](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7bufkPz3LRof205G/giphy.gif)

### 1) The HTML file

Let us first take a look at the HTML file (`index.html`).

At line 1 we have `<!DOCTYPE html>` This declares that this file is an HTML file. If we take a look in the `<html>` tag, we will find a `<body>` tag. Here's where we will write the code. Make sure that all the code you write is included between the opening and closing body tags. (`<body></body>`).

Make sure to remove line 5 (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">`) which may cause some weird responsiveness issues for our workshop.

![Image](https://cloud-8h5wlpd5b.vercel.app/metagif.gif)

### 2) The CSS file

This is the `style.css` file in your directory. Whatever styles we give to our website is written in this file. If you take a look in the `<head>` tag in your HTML, you will find a line of code (`<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />`). This means that your HTML file is properly linked to your CSS file!

### 3) The JavaScript file

This is the `script.js` file in your directory. It's empty for now, but we will fill it eventually through the workshop! The code written here will be responsible for the functioning of our clock.

If you take a look in the `<body>` tag, you'll find:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
This means that your HTML file is linked to your JavaScript.

## Part 4: Building the Clock

### 1) HTML

Let us start building our clock! First, we'll write the HTML code required.

Inside of our `<body>` tag, add a `<div>` tag with a class `clock`. Add another `<div>` tag inside of your existing `<div>` and give it a class of `clock-face`.

Now add 3 more `<div>` tags nested inside of the `clock-face` div. Give a class of `hand hour-hand`, `hand min-hand`, `hand second-hand` to each of the 3 new `<div>` tags respectively.

**Note:** Make sure the `<script>` tag, which is in your body, is below the `<div>` tags, or else it will throw you errors.

This is what your code should look like so far:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>repl.it</title>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="clock">
      <div class="clock-face">
        <div class="hand hour-hand"></div>
        <div class="hand min-hand"></div>
        <div class="hand second-hand"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

And that's it! We have completed writing our HTML.

### 2) CSS

After we have done writing the HTML, you'll notice that when we click `RUN`, you just see a white screen. Let's now add some styles to our elements!

Go to `style.css` in your repl.it directory. Let's start by adding some styles to our body! uhh... I meant `<body>`! Add the following code to your CSS:

```css
body {
  background: #01ed7f;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

**Explanation:**
3 main steps in writing CSS:
1. Select the element / class / id on which you want to apply your styles.
2. Open curly brackets `{}`.
3. Start adding your styles inside the curly brackets!

We start by giving our website a soothing green color. Go ahead and try changing it to the color of your own choice!

Then we removed the default margin and padding from all the elements in our website (some elements have a default value for their margin and padding such as 2.4, 3, etc). We changed the default display `display: block` to `display: flex`.

A very good reason for this is because `flex` enables you to align your items perfectly to the center! And that's what we have done in the next two lines. The `align-items` property aligns all your children elements to center, but horizontally. The `justify-content` property aligns all your children elements to center, but vertically.

Next, we have the `min-height` property which sets a minimum height of `100vh` (viewport height) to your `<body>`. The `min-height` property works together with the `align-items` property and helps the children to align properly at the center.

Learn more about [viewport heights](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-viewport-units-quick-start/).

Next, we'll need to add some styles to our clock! Following the 3 main steps given above, let's accomplish this task!

1. Select the class designated to the clock div.

![Image](https://cloud-namz2to6v.vercel.app/image.png)

2. Open curly brackets to write the stylings.

![Image](https://cloud-b7yg1ciea.vercel.app/image.png)

3. Add the following styles to this class.

```css
.clock {
  width: 25rem;
  height: 25rem;
  border: 20px solid whitesmoke;
  border-radius: 50px;
  background: blanchedalmond;
  background-image: url(https://bit.ly/2RcERUw);
  background-size: cover;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
              inset 0 0 0 3px #efefef,
              inset 0 0 10px black,
              0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

**Explanation**: 
We gave the width and height to our clock. Next, we gave it a border and the radius for the border. Next, is the background color for that clock (if you don't like it, consider changing it or even removing it).

Similarly, there's this line:

```css
background-image: url(https://bit.ly/2RcERUw);
```
That image is the face of the clock. we need to add `background-size: cover;` property, in order to show our image properly on the website screen.

Also, we have added some shadows to the element. We gave multiple shadows so as to get a cool effect on our clock. Also, the `inset` property changes the shadow from an outer shadow (`outset`) to an inner shadow.

Now let's test our code! Click on the **RUN** button and Voila! Here's the basic background for our clock! (if it doesn't look like this, make sure you crosscheck every single line of code).

![Image](https://cloud-dgjpl9scw.vercel.app/image.png)

Next, give `position: relative;` , `width: 100%;` & `height: 100%` to the class `.clock-face`.
(Try to do it on your own by following the 3 main steps of writing CSS).

Your CSS code so far:

```css
body {
  background: #01ed7f;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.clock {
  width: 25rem;
  height: 25rem;
  border: 20px solid whitesmoke;
  border-radius: 50px;
  background: blanchedalmond;
  background-image: url(https://bit.ly/2RcERUw);
  background-size: cover;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
              inset 0 0 0 3px #efefef,
              inset 0 0 10px black,
              0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.clock-face {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

Similarly, add more styles to your CSS code:

```css
.hand {
  background: black;
  height: 6px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  transform-origin: 100%;
  transform: rotate(90deg);
  transition: all 0.05s;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1);
}

.hour-hand {
  width: 30%;
  right: 50%;
}

.min-hand {
  width: 35%;
  right: 50%;
}

.second-hand {
  width: 40%;
  right: 50%;
}
```

**Explanation:** We give the clock hands a black color. We specify the clock hands' height and position.

Next, we give it a property of `top` to `50%`, basically it aligns the clock hands in the very center of our clock. To ensure that our clock rotates properly, we give the clock hands a `transform-origin: 100%;`. The transformation origin is the point around which a transformation is applied.

![Image](https://cloud-e99m314xu.vercel.app/image.png)

Next we added more transition properties such as:

```css
transition: all 0.05s;
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1);
```

The `transition: all 0.05s;` property sets a 0.05s animation duration. The `transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1);` property is just a transition effect applied to the clock!

Learn more about [transform-origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin).  
Learn more about [cubic-bezier](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_cubic-bezier.asp).

**Note:** The `.hand` class was given to 3 `<div>` tags which means this styling will affect all the 3 `<div>` tags. To give some extra classes to the hour hand, minute hand, and the second hand specifically, we also gave those 3 `<div>` tags a unique class name.

To align each hand properly, we give them a property of `right: 50%;`.

Here's what we have so far:

![Image](https://cloud-fprpa1onx.vercel.app/image.png)

**What we did so far:**  
- We built the structure of the clock with HTML.  
- We built the display of the clock with CSS.  
- Now with JavaScript, we will build the functionality of the clock.

## 3) JavaScript

So far, we have the clock hands aligned correctly and now in this section, we will animate them. Before panicking, let me ensure you that there are just 30 lines of JavaScript code!

Go to your `script.js` file. First let's link the `<div>` tags in our HTML to JavaScript. Type the following code:

```js
const secondHand = document.querySelector(".second-hand");
const minHand = document.querySelector(".min-hand");
const hourHand = document.querySelector(".hour-hand");
```

**Explanation:**
We declare the variables `secondHand`, `minHand`, `hourHand` using `const` and set their value to the first element that matches a specified CSS class(s) in the document. In our case, that CSS selectors are `.second-hand` , `.min-hand` , `.hour-hand` respectively.

**What is `querySelector()`?** The `querySelector()` method returns the first element that matches a specified CSS class(s) in the document.

Learn more about [query selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector).

Now it's time to implement a function for the proper functionality of the clock. Create a function `setDate` at the bottom of your file.

```js
function setDate() {

}
```

We can get the current date using the JavaScript `Date` object. Let's store it in a variable:

```js
function setDate() {
  const currentTime = new Date();
}
```
The `Date` object contains specific methods through which we can get the current hour / minute / second.

Learn more on [JavaScript dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).

Let's start by getting the current seconds, Add this code to the `setDate` function:

```js
const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
```
Now, if we want the hands to rotate, we can't simply feed the current time to it. We'll need to convert the current values into degrees and then do the transition. Time to do some maths!

![Image](https://media.giphy.com/media/26gR0YFZxWbnUPtMA/giphy.gif)

Code:

```js
function setDate() {
  const currentTime = new Date();
  const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
  const secondDeg = ((seconds / 60) * 360) + 90;
  secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondDeg}deg)`;
}
```

**Explanation:**
We have the current seconds between 1 - 60 stored in the `seconds` variable. We then create a new variable (`secondDeg`) in which we use an equation to convert the current seconds into degrees. In the next line, we add the transform style property to the `secondHand` which will rotate the hand according to the value of `secondDeg`.

**Note:** Here, we used backticks (``) instead of quotes (" "). This is an [ES6](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/) syntax. It helps us to write variables inside of strings.

So that line basically looks like:
```
eg: if secondDeg = 150;
then: secondHand.style.transform = 'rotate(150deg)'; 
```

![Image](https://cloud-bmrnpv27n.vercel.app/image.png)

**Challenge:** Do the same above process for fetching the minutes & hours and convert them into degrees.

**Hint:** Use the methods `getMinutes()` and `getHours()`.

The code so far:

```js
function setDate() {
  const currentTime = new Date();
	 
  const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
  const secondDeg = ((seconds / 60) * 360) + 90;
  secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondDeg}deg)`;

  const mins = currentTime.getMinutes();
  const minsDeg = ((mins / 60) * 360) + 90;
  minHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minsDeg}deg)`;

  const hours = currentTime.getHours();
  const hoursDeg = ((hours / 12) * 360) + 90;
  hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hoursDeg}deg)`;
}
```

Our clock is almost finished! We now just need to call that function repeatedly.

This is going to be a bit complex task, so let's do it step by step.

1. Call a `requestAnimationFrame()` function inside of our main function `setDate()`.

```js
function setDate() {
... // all the previous code
requestAnimationFrame();
}
```

2. Pass `setDate` to `requestAnimationFrame()`.

```js
function setDate() {
... // all the previous code
requestAnimationFrame(setDate);
}
```

3. Call the function `setDate()` at the very end of our JavaScript file.

**What is `requestAnimationFrame()`?** There used to be just one way to do a timed loop in JavaScript which was `setInterval()`. For the purpose of animation to appear smooth, (sixty frames per second) `requestAnimationFrame()` was introduced.

**Benefits of using `requestAnimationFrame()`:**
1. The browser can optimize it, so animations will be smoother.
2. Animations in inactive tabs will stop, allowing the CPU to chill.
3. More battery-friendly.

Learn more on [requestAnimationFrame()](https://css-tricks.com/using-requestanimationframe/).

Let us now try to run our code. And Voila! Our clock is ready!

Our code so far:
```js
const secondHand = document.querySelector(".second-hand");
const minHand = document.querySelector(".min-hand");
const hourHand = document.querySelector(".hour-hand");

function setDate() {
  const currentTime = new Date();

  const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
  const secondDeg = ((seconds / 60) * 360) + 90;
  secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondDeg}deg)`;

  const mins = currentTime.getMinutes();
  const minsDeg = ((mins / 60) * 360) + 90;
  minHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minsDeg}deg)`;

  const hours = currentTime.getHours();
  const hoursDeg = ((hours / 12) * 360) + 90;
  hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hoursDeg}deg)`;

  requestAnimationFrame(setDate);
}

setDate();
```

But let's wait for a minute to pass and see if its working correctly. Did you see a glitch which just happened for a millisecond? Let's fix it by adding this code inside our function before the `requestAnimationFrame(setDate)`:

```js
if(seconds == 0){
  secondHand.style.transitionDuration = '0s';
  minHand.style.transitionDuration = '0s';
  hourHand.style.transitionDuration = '0s';
} else {
  secondHand.style.transitionDuration = '0.05s';
  minHand.style.transitionDuration = '0.05s';
  hourHand.style.transitionDuration = '0.05s';
}
```

**Explanation** : 

Remember this code snippet which we wrote in our CSS file?

```css
.hand {
... // all the above code
  transition: all 0.05s; /* check near line 38. */
}
```

It specified the transition duration of 0.05s for the clock hands. Now to fix that bug, we'll remove this duration when the `second-hand` completes a minute.

**Step by step explanation:**

1. We use `if-else` statements to check if our current seconds are 0, i.e we check if we passed a minute.

2. When that statement is true, i.e when we pass a minute, we set the `transitionDuration` of all the clock hands to 0.

3. When that statement is not true, we keep all our `transitionDuration` to the normal value (0.05s).

4. This will prevent that bug from happening every minute.

The Final Code:

```js
const secondHand = document.querySelector(".second-hand");
const minsHand = document.querySelector(".min-hand");
const hourHand = document.querySelector(".hour-hand");

function setDate() {
  const currentTime = new Date();

  const seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
  const secondDeg = ((seconds / 60) * 360) + 90;
  secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondDeg}deg)`;

  const mins = currentTime.getMinutes();
  const minsDeg = ((mins / 60) * 360) + 90;
  minsHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minsDeg}deg)`;

  const hours = currentTime.getHours();
  const hoursDeg = ((hours / 12) * 360) + 90;
  hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hoursDeg}deg)`;

  if(seconds == 0){
    secondHand.style.transitionDuration = '0s';
    minsHand.style.transitionDuration = '0s';
    hourHand.style.transitionDuration = '0s';
  } else {
    secondHand.style.transitionDuration = '0.05s';
    minsHand.style.transitionDuration = '0.05s';
    hourHand.style.transitionDuration = '0.05s';
  }

  requestAnimationFrame(setDate);
}
setDate();
```

**And congratulations! You just built a clock using nearly 30 lines of JavaScript!**
