<!--
There are several ways to add the background image. Here is one way:

1. Google "html background image" (without quotes).
2. The first link brings you here: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp
3. There is an example near the top. You can click "Try it yourself" to see the full HTML of the example.
4. Add the <style> tag in the <head> like in the example, but replace the URL with the picture of the forest. You do not need the background-color rule since we are already setting a background image.
