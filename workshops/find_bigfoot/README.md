# Find Bigfoot

In this workshop, you will make a game about finding Bigfoot. It will look like
this:

![](img/final_screenshot.png)

Open the [live demo](https://ad510.github.io/workshop-test/find_bigfoot/). See
the [final code](examples/index.html).

**On the way, you will:**

- Learn how to do event handling and popup boxes in JavaScript.
- Set a background image for a web page.
- Directly set the coordinates of an element.
- Most importantly, practice Googling so you can become an independent hacker.

## Set up the project

If you've done other Hack Club workshops before, this should be pretty
straightforward.

### Create a blank HTML file

1. Go to https://c9.io
2. Under the workspace called `USERNAME.github.io` where `USERNAME` is your
   GitHub username, click **Open** to open the workspace.
3. Make a new folder called `find_bigfoot`.
4. In the `find_bigfoot` folder, make a new file called `index.html`.
5. Double-click `index.html` to open the file.

### Add standard HTML template

Type the standard HTML template into `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    
    </head>
    <body>
    
    </body>
</html>
```

### Open the live preview

1. Click **File > Save** to save the file.
2. Click **Preview > Live Preview File** to open a live preview of the web
   page. Currently it is blank but that will change soon!

## Creating the game

What needs to be in a game about finding Bigfoot? Well, it needs Bigfoot, and
it needs to tell the player when Bigfoot has been found.

### Taking Bigfoot out of his natural habitat

It is rumored that Bigfoot's natural habitat is a forest in the Pacific
Northwest. What happens if you take him out of his natural habitat and stick
him on a computer screen? Would he scream? Would he rip up the computer?

Luckily for you, we've done the hard part of wrangling him out of the jungle
and putting him in captivity on the Internet, right here:

```
https://hackclub.github.io/workshop-assets/find_bigfoot/bigfoot.png
```

So now you have to put an **image** of him into your game, like you did in the
Personal Website workshop. Remember how to do that? If you need a refresher,
[look
here](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/tree/master/workshops/personal_website#user-content-6-adding-an-image-with-the-image-tag).

When you are done, you should see Bigfoot in the live preview, like this:

![](img/bigfoot_image.png)

And the HTML looks like [this](examples/index1.html).

### Telling the player when Bigfoot has been found

A game needs interaction in order to be a game, so let's display a popup box
whenever the player clicks on Bigfoot, like this:

![](img/bigfoot_popup.png)

How can you do that?

One of the most important skills towards becoming an independent hacker is
knowing how to Google things when stuck. So let's start by Googling "[HTML
handle click](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+handle+click)":

> ![](img/google_html_handle_click.png)

Clicking the first link takes you
[here](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp):

> ![](img/w3schools_onclick.png)

Aha! It looks like whenever you put `onclick="myFunction()"` on a tag such as
`button` or `img`, it executes the
[**JavaScript**](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) code you put in the quotes
whenever that tag is clicked on.

We want our JavaScript code to display a popup box saying you won. So now let's
Google "[JavaScript popup
box](https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+popup+box)":

> ![](img/google_javascript_popup_box.png)

The first link takes you [here](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp):

> ![](img/w3schools_popup.png)

It looks like when you run `alert("I am an alert box!");` it opens a popup box
showing the text inside the quotes. So if we put 2 and 2 together, our `img`
tag should look like this:

```html
<img src="https://hackclub.github.io/workshop-assets/find_bigfoot/bigfoot.png"
     onclick="alert("Woohoo, you win! You found Bigfoot!");">
```

Change your `img` tag to look like that too, then click Bigfoot in the live
preview.

Oops, it didn't work! Why could that be?

Another important skill when hacking is knowing how to fix stuff when they go
wrong. Cloud9 gives a couple hints:

1. It displayed the message "Unable to update preview: unmatched tags detected"
2. The quotation mark after `alert(` has a red underline.

Here's what went wrong. We expected the quotation mark after `alert(` to
indicate the beginning of the message, but what it actually did was indicate
the end of the `onclick` attribute.

Here's a little trick you can use to fix that. In JavaScript, you can use
either `"` or `'` around text (the technical term is a
[**string**](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp)). So change the inner
quotes to single quotes, like this:

```
onclick="alert('Woohoo, you win! You found Bigfoot!');"
```

And now clicking Bigfoot should display the message.

At this point, `index.html` looks like [this](examples/index2.html).

### Celebrate!

Congratulations, you have a working game now! You're all done! Now you can go
to [FGL](https://fgl.com) and sell your game to sponsors and make millions of
dollars!

## Hiding Bigfoot

I guess you spotted the problem already. This game is way too easy! I mean,
Bigfoot is just sitting there out in the open, begging for you to click on him.

### Putting Bigfoot back in his natural habitat

That must be because we took him out of his natural habitat. You see, normally
Bigfoot is hiding in a dense forest, making it hard to find him. Let's fix that
by adding a **background image** of a forest. I like this one:

```
https://hackclub.github.io/workshop-assets/find_bigfoot/trees.jpg
```

When you are making your own projects, you won't have workshops telling the
solution to every step. So this time, let's practice your Googling skills and
see if you can figure out how to set that background image without being told
the solution! After adding the background image, the live preview looks like
this:

![](img/bigfoot_background.png)

When you are done, or if you are simply really stuck, here is a [sample
solution](examples/index3.html). (But there are other ways to add the
background image, so if your solution doesn't match mine, that's OK.)

### Setting Bigfoot's location

That's much better! But the top left corner is a pretty boring place to hide
Bigfoot. Can you figure out how to set Bigfoot's **position** to somewhere
else? This one is harder, and may take some trial and error, but it's really
worth the effort to see if you can figure it out yourself. Afterwards,
Bigfoot's position will be somewhere in the middle of the forest, rather than
the top left corner, like this:

![](img/bigfoot_position.png)

.

.

OK, got it working? If you need help, try asking your neighbor or a club leader
for hints.

#### Sample solution

Let's walk through the steps of one way of solving this.

Google "[HTML position](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+position)".

> ![](img/google_html_position.png)

The first link takes you
[here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp):

> ![](img/w3schools_position.png)

It has some CSS code showing how to "position an `<h2>` element":

```css
h2 {
    position: absolute;
    left: 100px;
    top: 150px;
}
```

But we don't want to position an `<h2>` element. We want to position an `<img>`
element. So we type the code above into the `<style>` section, but typing `img`
instead of `h2`.

When we're done, `index.html` looks like [this](examples/index.html). But feel
free to experiment with the `left` and `top` values to find a good place to
hide Bigfoot.

### Celebrate!

Now you have made a more interesting game. And more importantly, by practicing
Googling stuff, you are on your way toward becoming an independent hacker.

## Sharing with the community

Like with previous workshops, let's set up a link that you can share with others!

1. Open the terminal by pressing `alt + t` on the keyboard at the same time.
   Then type in the following commands:
  - `git add --all`
  - `git commit -am "Find Bigfoot workshop"`
  - `git push origin master`

4. GitHub will now ask you for your username and password.
  - Go ahead and enter your username and then press the enter.
  - Then enter your password and press enter. _Note that the characters don't
    show up on the screen but rest assured, you are still typing._
5. Now try to view your game by going to `username.github.io/find_bigfoot`

   > Make sure to change `username` to your own username

6. Post the link to [Ship It](https://shipit.hackclub.io) and
   [Slack](https://starthackclub.slack.com)!

## Hacking

Now is the chance to make the game into your own! For inspiration, you can look
