[Final code](https://repl.it/@GurshanBrar/Javascript-Typing-Test-Final)

### Prerequisites
This project will be more fun to code if you have a general understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, don't worry if you don't because you can definitely complete this workshop without any prerequisites.

### The IDE
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is just fancy speak for where your code will run. We'll be using [repl.it](https://repl.it) as our IDE because...

1. It saves your code in the cloud
2. All you need is an internet connection and a web browser
3. It's really easy to fork (copy) from

# Let's start!

## Step 0: Forking the starter repl
To fork (copy) the starter template,

1. Navigate to the [Starter Template](https://replit.com/@GurshanBrar/Javascript-Typing-Test-Starter)
2. Edit anything and the template will be copied as one of your repls
3. Click on the run button to run the website, and click on the "open in a new tab" button on the right of the url inside the repl's output.

## Step 1: Explaining the starter template

Now that you've forked the starter project, let's quickly go over the code that was just dumped in your lap:

In the `index.html` file, we're:

- Setting some metadata
- Importing [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), which will help us style our website
- Linking the `style.css` file to the `index.html` file
- Setting up the content on the website (the purpose of each line will become clear as we go along)
- Import Bootstrap's scripts
- Importing our `script.js` file

In the `style.css` file, we're just setting up some initial styles.

In the `script.js` file, we're selecting some elements from our HTML file so that we can easily modify them in the workshop.

If you're curious to see what the starter code outputs, click the green "Run" button at the top of the page.

If you don't understand some of the code, you're welcome to ask your club leader or someone around you for some help. But don't worry about understanding every single lineâ€”it'll become a lot clearer as we go along.

## Step 2: Coding our JavaScript

Let's start writing some JavaScript! Our program will be split up into three blocks that provide functionality: ```handleKey(key)```, ```handleEnd()```, and the event listener. We'll also have variables defined at the beginning to assist these three blocks. Let me explain how our program will flow:

1. First we'll declare variables for our text, time, position, etc.
2. Then we'll start our event listener. Everytime a key is pressed it will check if the key is a valid symbol or letter. It'll forward the key to ```handleKey(key)``` if it is, otherwise ignore it.
3. Every time ```handleKey(key)``` gets a character, it checks it against the text. If it's correct it increments the position in the text and changes the letter's color to green. Otherwise it changes it to red and sets a ```backspaceNeeded``` variable.
4. When the user is done typing, the ```handleEnd()``` function computes the results, changes the CSS ```display``` property, and modifies the HTML content.

We'll code our program section by section!

#### Section 1:
All the variables we declare on the top will be available to our functions! So we don't have to worry about variable accessibility. 

Lets start off by creating an ```invalidKeys``` array and a text string. Navigate to the `script.js` file (if you aren't there already) and add this at the end of the file:
```javascript
const invalidKeys = 'F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 F11 F12 Escape Tab CapsLock Shift Control Alt Meta ArrowLeft ArrowRight ArrowDown ArrowUp Enter'.split(
    ' ',
);
const text =
    'Hello there! I hope your day is going well. Thanks for trying out my typing test. Did you know that this project was actually made for Hackclub? Hackclub is a worldwide, student led coding club for teens that strives to provide a comfortable and educational place to collaborate with others!';
```
The first variable is used by our event listener and lists all the keys we won't count as *errors* when typing. We use JavaScript's built-in [```split()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) function to separate the string into an [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

An array in JavaScript is a variable that can store a list of many variables. A specific variable inside an array is accesible by an index value that starts at zero. Index 0 corresponds to the first element in the array. Index 1 contributes to the second, and so on. Arrays are initialized like this: ```let array = ['string', 'apple']```.

![Image that explains index](https://cloud-ei7nqg21v.vercel.app/3index_demo.png)

The ```split()``` function splits a string into an array based on a delimeter. The delimeter is the string we add in its parantheses as a parameter. So every time it sees the parameter we passed in, it makes a new array element.

Finally we have a string that defines what text we'll add for our typing test. Add this at the end:
```javascript
const textArr = text.split('');
const htmlArr = textArr.map((item, index, array) => {
    if (item === ' ') {
        return `<span class="space" id="span${index}">${item}</span>`;
    }
    return `<span class="char" id="span${index}">${item}</span>`;
});
```
We split our text string into an array for easier checking. Now, every letter is an element in the array. 

To show text in our HTML, we'll need to split every letter into a ```<span>``` element. We use JavaScript's ```map()``` method to make a new array based on a certain condition. ```map()``` goes through ```textArr``` and calls a function. That function is used to tell the ```map()``` function what to add into the new array. Whatever the function returns, the ```map()``` function adds in to ```htmlArr```. If the character in ```textArr``` is a space we assign a different CSS class. 

A new syntax is used: ``` `span${index}` ```. These backticks allow you to easily enter variables in a string. Use the dollar sign and brackets to add in a variable. Now, lets add in the final variables at the end:
```javascript
let errors = [];
textContainer.innerHTML = htmlArr.join('');
let firstTime = true;
let currentPos = 0;
let backspaceNeeded = false;
let currentTime = 0;
let repeat;
```
I'll go over this line by line. We make an empty ```errors``` array to store any mistakes made when typing. We join together the ```<span>``` elements in our ```htmlArr``` into a string using the ```join()``` function. That function joins all elements of an array together with a string in between. We make a ```firstTime``` variable to check if it's the user's first letter typed. 

```currentPos``` is a counter used to track the position of the user in the ```textArr``` array. ```backspaceNeeded``` tells the program that a backspace has to be typed to continue. ```currentTime``` simply stores the time in seconds, and repeat is used to set an interval for the timer. I'll get back to the interval later.

#### Section 2: 
Now that we've declared all of our variables, we need to start our event listener. The event listener simply consists of a function that runs when a key is pressed. The event listener will call the ```handleKey(key)``` function that takes care of the key that was pressed. Add this code at the end of your file:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
    if (event.key === ' ') {
        event.preventDefault();
    }
    if (firstTime) {
        firstTime = false;
        repeat = setInterval(() => currentTime++, 1000);
    }
    if (event.location === 0 && !invalidKeys.includes(event.key)) {
        handleKey(event.key);
    }
});
```
We add a listener on the JavaScript ```document``` variable, using JavaScript's built in method called [```addEventListener('eventType', function)```](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_addeventlistener.asp). This function adds a listener on whatever variable we call it from. Since we called it from ```document``` it adds one on the whole page. The function takes two arguments: the type of event that will call the function, and the code to run once the event happens. 

![Image explaining ```document```](https://cloud-ei7nqg21v.vercel.app/2document_demo.png)

The first argument is the ```'keydown'``` string. This string tells the listener to activate once any key is pressed down. The second argument is a function. That function is called whenever our listener picks up a ```'keydown'``` event. The function takes one argument: the ```event``` variable. This variable contains information about our event.

The function we use first checks if ```event.key``` is a space (empty string). It does this by using the ```===``` operator. That operator compares two values. If they are the same it returns ```true```. To check what ```event```'s properties are on a certain keypress, check out [keycode.info](keycode.info).

```event.key``` returns the literal string representation of the key that was pressed. If it is a space, we use the ```event``` [```preventDefault()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) function. That function prevents the normal behavior of the key. Without this, whenever we type a space the page scrolls automatically to the end (which is very annoying).

We then check if it's the first key that was typed. The code in an [```if```](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp) statement in JavaScript runs if the condition in the parentheses is ```true```. Otherwise it skips over. Since ```firstTime``` is literally set to ```true```, the code runs. The code first changes the variable to ```false``` so that it doesn't run again, and sets an ```interval```. 

[```setInterval()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) repeats a function periodically. We give it a time in miliseconds to repeat, and a function to call. The function inside of it is called an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). 

Arrow functions are just normal functions but shorthand. The first part of our arrow function is `()`. `()` is usually where parameters would go. A parameter is a variable given to a function to allow the variable's use inside the function. We need no parameters, so we give it an empty value. We then use `=>` to represent that it's an arrow function. After `=>` we write our function normally. Our function's body in this case just increments the currentTime by 1. `++` is an operator that increases the value of the operand by 1 (just increases the ```currentTime``` variable, and it repeats every 1000 miliseconds (1 second), so it's basically a timer we created).

We do another equality check, this time making sure that the [```location```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/location) property of the event is ```0```, and making sure that the key isn't inside our ```invalidKeys``` array. The ```location``` property being zero means that the key was one of the general key presses. Additionally we use our array ```invalidKeys```'s, built-in [```includes()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes) method to check if an element is inside that array.

The ```!``` operator reverses the outcome of the condition. So if the key is inside ```invalidKeys``` it'll return true but we need it to return false. So we add the ```!``` in the front. In the middle we use an two ampersands (&&) to influence our ```if``` condition. Basically the operator means that if the condition on the left and right are both true, only then will the whole condition be true. That way we can be sure that the key is okay to be included.

We finally call our ```handleKey(key)``` function, and give the function access to our key. We'll make this next, but first a final code check.

    }

        handleKey(event.key);
    }
});
```

</details>

#### Section 3:
In this section we make our ```handleKey(key)``` function! This function changes the color of the key, changes the position of the key in the array, and forces backspaces. To start, add this at the end of the `script.js` file:
```javascript
function handleKey(key) {
    let span = document.getElementById(`span${currentPos}`).style;
    if (!backspaceNeeded) {
        if (key === textArr[currentPos]) {
            span.color = 'green';
            currentPos++;
        } else {
            if (textArr[currentPos] === ' ') {
                span.backgroundColor = 'red';
            } else {
                span.color = 'red';
            }
            backspaceNeeded = true;
            errors.push(textArr[currentPos]);
        }
    } else {
        if (event.key === 'Backspace') {
            if (textArr[currentPos] === ' ') {
                span.backgroundColor = 'transparent';
            } else {
                span.color = 'black';
            }
            backspaceNeeded = false;
        }
    }
    if (currentPos === textArr.length) {
        clearInterval(repeat);
        handleEnd();
    }
}
```
We first get the span element that corresponds with the current position. We get its [```style```](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_style.asp) property to modify the CSS. 

By using `if (!backspaceNeeded) {` We make sure the there isn't a backspace needed. Meaning, we make sure the `backspaceNeeded` isn't true. If it isn't, we validate the key pressed by comparing its equality with the current position in the ```textArr```. `textArr[currentPos]` means that we are accessing the element at `currentPos` index of the array. If it's correct we set the color to green (`span.color = 'green';`) by using the CSS `color` property, and increment the ```currentPos``` variable. `++` means to increase the value before it by 1.

If the pressed key isn't correct, meaning that the `else` statement gets executed, we check if the current letter inside `textArr` is a space or letter in another `if` statement. A space refers to `' '` and it's a letter if it isn't a space. We then change either the ```backgroundColor``` or the ```color```. `backgroundColor` is required to be changed if the letter in `textArr` (the letter the user needs to type) is a space since `color` only applies to text. If it isn't correct we also set ```backspaceNeeded``` to true and add the letter into the ```errors``` array. 

The [`push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) method is a method used on arrays to add an element at the end of the array. We add the letter that was supposed to be typed at the end of the `errors` array so that we can log how many errors the user made.

If there is a backspace needed, we only execute code if the ```key``` is a backspace. We do this so that our program doesn't continue when a backspace is needed. After doing the appropriate check for space or letter, we change the color to `black` if it's a letter, and `transparent` if it's a space. `transparent` is the default `backgroundColor` and `black` is the default color in our case. This resets the colors back to normal. Finally we reset the ```backspaceNeeded``` variable if the key pressed was indeed a backspace.

At the end we make sure that if the current position has been incremented to ```textArr.length```, we stop the timer function by doing `clearInterval(repeat)`. This takes the `setInterval()` method's variable `repeat` that we assigned, and stops it from repeating. We finally call our ```handleEnd()``` function to show the results. Since array indexes reference **one more than the index value** having an index equivalent to the array's length would reference a non-existant value. Therefore we know that we have reached the end of the program.

#### Section 4:
Now we need to add the final segement of our code: the ```handleEnd()``` function. This function calculates the results, modifies the HTML, and changes the display properties that hide the results. Add this at the end:
```javascript
function handleEnd() {
    let wpm = Math.floor(textArr.length / 5 / (currentTime / 60));
    let accuracy = Math.floor(
        ((textArr.length - errors.length) / textArr.length) * 100,
    );
    let multiples = Math.floor(currentTime / 60);
    let seconds = currentTime - multiples * 60;
    wpmText.innerHTML = `${wpm} wpm`;
    accuracyText.innerHTML = `${accuracy}%`;
    timeText.innerHTML = `${multiples} m ${seconds} s`;
    main.style.display = 'none';
    resultsContainer.style.display = 'block';
}
```
First off, we calculate the time, the wpm, and the accuracy. If you want to learn how they are calculated, refer to [this site](https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-equations). But basically, we use `Math.floor()` to round results down, and divide by integers to compute our result. We finally store them in variables. JavaScript math operations follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). Therefore we can ensure that our result is accurate.

As for the time, we get the minutes first. To get the minutes we divide the time by 60. The remainder is chopped off because we use ```Math.floor()``` (```Math.floor()``` rounds the result down). We then store the leftover seconds in ```seconds```. We modify the ```innerHTML``` properties of our ```wpmText```, ```accuracyText```, and ```timeText``` variables. Remember that these variables were declared at the very top of our file and refer to HTML elements. 

![Image describing ```innerHTML```, ```outerHTML```, and ```innerText```](https://cloud-ei7nqg21v.vercel.app/1inner_html_demo.png)

Finally, we set the display of our ```main``` container to ```'none'``` and the ```resultsContainer``` to ```'block'```. We can do this by referencing the HTML `style` attribute. The `style` attribute adds an inline `style` to the HTML element. To create the `style` attribute we can reference it as an object `key`. We can then add CSS styles inside of it. Our style hides the text and shows the results by using the CSS `display` property. Remember we set the display of our `resultsContainer` to `none`? Our JavaScript `style` attribute overrides that property and returns the `resultsContainer` back to its default value. We now set a new property on the `main` container to hide it.

## Step 3: Hacking

![Image resembling finishing a race](https://cloud-ei7nqg21v.vercel.app/0finished.jpeg)

Thats it! We've finished coding the typing test workshop. You should feel proud of yourself because you learned many new skills such as functions, backticks, operators, ```if``` statements, and more! This workshop is pretty hackable, though. Here are some examples of extending it:

- A try again button! We can add a try again button to our workshop. Here's the [final demo](https://javascript-typing-test-final-1.gurshanbrar.repl.co/) and the [source code](https://repl.it/@GurshanBrar/JavaScript-Typing-Test-v1#index.html).
- Save our results in ```localStorage```. ```localStorage``` is a place on a user's browser to store data. We can store the results there, and fetch them every time we complete the typing test! The [final demo](https://javascript-typing-test-v2.gurshanbrar.repl.co/) and the [source code](https://repl.it/@GurshanBrar/JavaScript-Typing-Test-v2#script.js).
- Add a nice little navbar. We can add a navbar that links to your github and has a link to Hackclub. Just make sure to read the comment inside the HTML file. The [final demo](https://javascript-typing-test-v3.gurshanbrar.repl.co/) and the [source code](https://repl.it/@GurshanBrar/JavaScript-Typing-Test-v3#index.html).
