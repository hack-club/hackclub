## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started you should have a basic knowledge of:

- HAHA! Nothing, this is a beginner-friendly workshop.

### So let's begin üí®

# Creating a Dialogflow Agent üíª

First, you will need to create a Dialogflow agent.

Dialogflow agent is a virtual agent that handles conversations with your end-users.

So for creating an agent you need to visit [Dialogflow console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/newAgent)

After visiting, you will see a page similar to this:

![Landing page](https://cloud-501jqj1w8.vercel.app/01.png)

Here at the top, you'll see the `Agent name` section

![Agent name](https://cloud-501jqj1w8.vercel.app/12.png)

Here you have to give a name to your Dialogflow agent such as `simple-chatbot`.

After giving a name just click on the `CREATE` button.

![Creating agent](https://cloud-501jqj1w8.vercel.app/23.png)

After creating Agent you'll be redirected to the Intents page.

An [Intent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/intents-overview#:~:text=An%20intent%20categorizes%20an%20end%2Duser's%20intention%20for%20one%20conversation%20turn.&text=When%20an%20end%2Duser%20writes,also%20known%20as%20intent%20classification.) categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation turn.

![Intents page](https://cloud-501jqj1w8.vercel.app/34.png)

Here you'll see two default intents:

- Default Fallback intent
- Default Welcome intent

So, in this workshop, you don't need it as you will create on our own. So, you have to delete them.

To delete just hover the cursor over it and you'll see the delete icon.

![delete default intent](https://cloud-ja1qqre3i.vercel.app/410.png)

After deleting both intents click on the `CREATE INTENT` button to create new intents.

![create intent](https://cloud-501jqj1w8.vercel.app/45.png)

Here you will create two intents in this workshop:

1. ask-name:
¬† ¬†
¬† ¬†In this you will trigger the bot by welcome commands like `Hello`, `Hi` & `Hey` and the bot will ask your name.

2. final-output:

¬† ¬†In this, you will give your name to the bot and the bot will return your name with some comment like `Hey {your name}, Nice to meet you!` and end the conversation.

# Creating Intents üìù

### 1. ask-name:

When you landed on the intents page you will see a page similar to this:

![intent page](https://cloud-ja1qqre3i.vercel.app/06.png)

Here you have to give a name to your first intent such as `ask-name`.

![intent ask-name](https://cloud-ja1qqre3i.vercel.app/28.png)

On that page you'll see a block name `Traning Phrases` and there you'll see the `ADD TRAINING PHRASES` button. So, click on it.

Training phrases are example phrases for what end-users might type or say to trigger that intent.

![Training phrase a-n](https://cloud-ja1qqre3i.vercel.app/39.png)

So, add training phrases like `Hello`, `Hii`, `Hey`, and anything you want to trigger the intent!

![Adding phrases](https://cloud-oqmxib6bs.vercel.app/011.png)

Now, after adding several training phrases scroll down the page till you see a block name `Responses`.

Responses are the response from the bot when you trigger it with the training phrases you mentioned above.

![Responses](https://cloud-oqmxib6bs.vercel.app/112.png)

So, add some responses like you need to ask name,¬†
`Hello! what is your name?`,¬†¬†
`Welcome! what is your name?` etc.

![Add responses](https://cloud-oqmxib6bs.vercel.app/213.png)

After adding responses, again scroll up till you see the `Contexts` block.

Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you "they are orange", you need context to understand what "they" are referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with the context to correctly match an intent.

As you need to pass the name given by you to the next intent so you need to add contexts.

![Context](https://cloud-oqmxib6bs.vercel.app/314.png)

Contexts block has two input sections:

- Input Context: It is used to take a reference from previous intent.

- Output Context: It is used to give a reference to the next intent.

As you need to pass a name to the next intent you will add output context.

Give a name to a context like `name`.

![Context name](https://cloud-oqmxib6bs.vercel.app/415.png)

As you can see there is a number before the `name`, it shows the lifespan of that context. It is `5` by default so change it to `1` as you need to pass it to one intent (the next intent).

![context lifespan](https://cloud-ie8dhb70i.vercel.app/116.png)

So, at last click on the `SAVE` button.

Hooray! You created you successfully first intent.

To create second intent, click on the `+` icon in the `Intents` tab on the left menu.

![New intent](https://cloud-ie8dhb70i.vercel.app/016.1.png)

After clicking on it, you'll be landed on the new intents page.

### 2. final-output:

Here, give a name to your intent `final-output`.

As you created an output context in the previous intent, you need to add it here.

So click on the `contexts` block

![Next context](https://cloud-ie8dhb70i.vercel.app/217.png)

In the input context field add `name` as you have passed `name` from previous intent.

![Context input](https://cloud-ie8dhb70i.vercel.app/318.png)

After adding context, you need to add training phrases like previous intent.

As the bot is asking your name, so add some random names to it.

![Training names](https://cloud-ie8dhb70i.vercel.app/419.png)

After adding training phrases, scroll down till you see a block `Actions and Parameters`.

![Action and parameter](https://cloud-ie8dhb70i.vercel.app/520.png)

Here you need to add some actions.

The action field is a simple convenience field that assists in executing logic in your service.
When building an agent, you can set this field to any text you find useful.

Here you will find different fields and you need to work on these fields given below:

- **Required**: Check this box if the parameter is required for the intent to be complete.
- **Parameter Name**: A name that identifies the parameter, like `name`
- **Entity**: The entity type associated with the parameter, like `@sys.any`.
- **Value**: It is a parameter reference like `$name`, which is used as a placeholder for the extracted value at runtime.

![Action fills](https://cloud-mededak1r.vercel.app/021.png)

Here you have to choose the Entity as an `@sys.any` because Entity `@sys.give-name` has limited names to recognize.

How it looks like:

![Final actions](https://cloud-mededak1r.vercel.app/122.png)

After adding actions you need to match actions with your training phrases.

So go to training phrases block and highlight each phrase and you will see a page similar to this:

![Match phrases](https://cloud-mededak1r.vercel.app/223.png)

So mark phrase with action `@sys.any:name`.

![Mark phrase](https://cloud-mededak1r.vercel.app/324.png)

Do it for each phrase.

![All marked phrase](https://cloud-mededak1r.vercel.app/425.png)

After marking all phrases with action, you need to add a response that the bot will give after you give a name.

So, scroll down to the `Responses` block.

![End Responses](https://cloud-mededak1r.vercel.app/526.png)

Add some responses like:

- `Hey! nice to meet you`.
- `Thanks for using me`.

![Response added](https://cloud-mededak1r.vercel.app/627.png)

Here you can see the `$name` keyword, it is the reference you have given in the actions block to recognize names.
So `$name` will return the name which is entered by the user.

Example:¬†¬†
I entered the name `Steve` then `Hello $name` will return `Hello Steve`.

As this will be the end of the conversation, so below the `ADD RESPONSES` button you will see `Set this intent as the end of conversation`. So, enable it.

At last click on `SAVE` to save this intent.

![Save last intent](https://cloud-mededak1r.vercel.app/728.png)

Now, our agent is ready to test!

# Testing Agent üïµÔ∏è

You will test your agent in a form of a web demo.

So for that click on the Integrations tab on the left menu.

![Integration](https://cloud-ay0nti5f8.vercel.app/029.png)

After clicking on the integration you will see a page similar to this:

![Integration main page](https://cloud-ay0nti5f8.vercel.app/130.png)

Here you can integrate your agent on various platforms where it is slack, Telegram, Twilio, or your webpage.

So, you will create a web demo, so scroll down till you find the `Web Demo` block.

![Web demo](https://cloud-ay0nti5f8.vercel.app/231.png)

Click on it to enable a web demo for your agent.

After enabling a new page will pop-up.

![Web demo page](https://cloud-ay0nti5f8.vercel.app/332.png)

Here you will find a link to your agent also some sort of code that is used to embed it on your webpage.

So, click on that link to open your agent on the web.

![Link click](https://cloud-ay0nti5f8.vercel.app/433.png)

Now, you can see your agent or your simple-chat bot on a webpage!

![Agent on web](https://cloud-ay0nti5f8.vercel.app/534.png)
