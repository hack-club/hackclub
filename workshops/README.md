# Workshops

Welcome to our workshops library, where you'll find all the workshops offered by
Hack Club. Choose a track to get started!

Each workshop is around an hour long and walks you through the process of
_building somethingâ„¢_ (like a website, app, or game). Our philosophy is that the
best way to learn to code is to immediately get your feet wet and build real
things (instead of starting out learning concepts).

The best way to utilize these workshops is to choose a track and then set aside
3-4 hours after each workshop to keep expanding on what you built (for example,
adding multiplayer support to the [Soccer game](soccer/README.md)).

If you have any questions or run into any trouble, just ask us on the Slack
([click here](../SLACK.md) for instructions on joining the Slack) :smile:.

## The Track

This is our recommended workshop flow. Through it you'll learn the fundamentals
of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through building _real_ things. You'll start off
by building your first website and will eventually make your way through the
fundamentals of game development.

1. [Personal Website][personal_website]: _Set up your development tools and
   build your first website_
2. [Twilio][twilio]: _Use code to call and text your phone_
3. [Soccer][soccer]: _Build your first browser game_
4. [Dodge][dodge]: _Expand upon what you started in Soccer and build your
   second, more advanced game_
5. [Maze][maze]: _This one's super free-form. Build your third game and
   thoroughly customize it to truly make it your own._
6. [Ajar.io][ajar]: _Much more advanced and detailed than previous game
   workshops. Build a single-player clone of https://agar.io/_.
