# Workshops!

Welcome to the workshops library! This is the home of all of the content rendered on [workshops.hackclub.com](https://workshops.hackclub.com) and used in Hack Clubs all over the globe.

Anyone can contribute to workshops, and there are different ways you can help: If you want to create a new workshop, all you have to do is submit a pull request that creates a new directory in this folder with the name of your workshop (ex. `personal_website`) and includes a file called `README.md` in the created directory with the content of your workshop (ex. [`personal_website/README.md`](personal_website/README.md). As soon as your pull request gets merged, it'll be live at https://hackclub.com/workshops.

And if you want to translate an existing workshop into your native language to make it accessible for more people to learn, this are the steps you have to follow:

First locate the directory of the workshop you would like to translate, and then add your translated workshop in a file named with the language code of the language you translated it to, for example, if I would like to translate the `personal_website` workshop into Latin American Spanish, I would include it in a file named `es-xl.md`.

`README.md` and the translated `.md` files must be written in the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax. We recommend [this cheatsheet](http://commonmark.org/help/) for getting started with Markdown.

If you have any questions, please [join us on the Slack](https://slack.hackclub.com) and we'll be more than happy to give you a hand :smile:.
