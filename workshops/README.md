# Workshops

Welcome to our workshops library, where you'll find all the workshops offered by
Hack Club. Choose a track to get started!

Each workshop is around an hour long and walks you through the process of
_building somethingâ„¢_ (like a website, app, or game). Our philosophy is that the
best way to learn to code is to immediately get your feet wet and build real
things (instead of starting out learning concepts).

The best way to utilize these workshops is to choose a track and then set aside
3-4 hours after each workshop to keep expanding on what you built (for example,
adding multiplayer support to the [Soccer game](soccer/README.md)).

If you have any questions or run into any trouble, just ask us on the Slack
([click here](../SLACK.md) for instructions on joining the Slack) :smile:.
