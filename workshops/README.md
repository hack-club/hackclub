# Workshops!

Welcome to the workshops library! This is the home of all of the content rendered on https://hackclub.com/workshops and used in Hack Clubs all over the globe.

Anyone can contribute a workshop. All you have to do is submit a pull request that creates a new directory in this folder with the name of your workshop (ex. `personal_website`) and includes a file called `README.md` in the created directory with the content of your workshop (ex. [`personal_website/README.md`](personal_website/README.md#part-i-setup). As soon as your pull request gets merged, it'll be live at https://hackclub.com/workshops.

`README.md` must be written in the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax. We recommend [this cheatsheet](http://commonmark.org/help/) for getting started with Markdown.

If you have any questions, please [join us on the Slack](slack/README.md) and we'll be more than happy to give you a hand :smile:.
