# ![Slack](img/slack_logo.png)
Slack is an awesome tool for large group chats (check out their website at  https://slack.com). Hack Club's Slack is the home of our community. We use it to ask each other questions, talk about the problems we run into (as members and club leaders), and hang out with each other.

When you join this is what you’ll see.
