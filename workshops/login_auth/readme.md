# Login Authentication ðŸ”’

In this workshop you'll build a web login page using firebase. In which only those peoples who are added to database can login.

This is a workshop to help you make something like this ðŸ‘‡

## Getting Started :rocket:
### Creating a firebase project -
At first you'll need to sign-in to firebase console. if you have google account then you can directly sign-in to firebase, otherwise create one.

After sign-in you will see an interface like image below.

In the above image you'll see `Go to console` tab at top right corner, so click on that and you will be redirected to console section.

In the console section you'll see all your firebase projects and here you'll see `Add Project Card` so click on that to create a new project.

Here you will need to give a name to your firebase project as i am giving `Login-auth`.

After giving a wonderful name to your project just click on continue to proceed further.

Here is an optional step, If you need Google Analytics for your projects to can click on `enable` otherwise continue.

So here you'll see `Your new project is ready`. Hooray!ðŸŽ‰ you just created your new firebase project.

So now before moving to project console, we need to setup our webpage in which we can login so lets proceed further.

### Creating a webpage ðŸ’» - 

Yea! it is the important part for this workshop, you need to create a webpage and design a login page card using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I have already created a code template so you can check it out and i will explain some parts if code which is important.

**Code** : [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@tanishqsoni/Loginauth)

#### Explaination of code </>

##### HTML
HTML code is not complex here, I have created two divisons `main-div` & `loggedin-div`. 
- `main-div`
  - It is the main division which consists:
    - Input fields like `email-field` and `password-field`.
    - Login button with onclick function `login()`.
- `loggedin-div`
  - It is the logged in divison which consists:
    - Logout button with onclick function `logout()`.
    
You can edit [HTML](https://repl.it/@tanishqsoni/Loginauth#index.html) file here.

don't forgot to link HTML file with the CSS and JavaScript file using:

_CSS_
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

_JavaScript_
```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

##### CSS
The style of webpage is completely of your own choice like whether you need blue colour or black, you need rectangle buttons or circle! its completely yours. 

You can edit [CSS](https://repl.it/@tanishqsoni/Loginauth#style.css) file here.

##### JAVASCRIPT

The main part of webpage comes here, not to complex but somewhat and you can also read [firebase Auth documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start?authuser=0).

In the JavaScript file first you need to add a `AuthState` property which will determine the next steps using conditions `user is signed-in` & `no user is signed-in`.

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function(user) {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
  }
});
```
As you now we created two divisions in HTML and we need `loggedin-div` division to be displayed only when the user is signed-in so in above code we need to do some changes,
but before we make changes we need to assign `IDs` to both divisions:
ID `user_div` to division `loggedin-div`
ID `login_div` to division `main-div`
After assigning IDs add this code in the `if` statement of `AuthState` property.
```javascript

document.getElementById("user_div").style.display = "block";
document.getElementById("login_div").style.display = "none";

```
In the above code `block` will display that division and `none` will hide that division.
As we added this for signed-in user so we also need `else` part _while user is not signed-in_ so the code will same as above code but we need to swap `block` and `none` as we need to show only `main-div` so add below code to `else` statement of `AuthState` property.

```javascript

document.getElementById("user_div").style.display = "none";
document.getElementById("login_div").style.display = "block";

```
