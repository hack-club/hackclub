[**Hack Club**](https://hackclub.com/) is a global, nonprofit network of high school makers & student-led coding clubs. This repository is where we store our [Workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com), which are self-led learn-to-code tutorials, as well as our [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/).

## Philosophy

We think learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you from a _consumer_ to a _creator_, turning your computer into a tool for creation. If you’re reading this, you can learn to build an app—there’s never been a better time for making.

**The goal of Hack Club is to help you become a hacker.** We want an inclusive space on the internet & at every school where people are making interesting things with code, every week. In our [online Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) (Discord-style online chatroom with 15K student members), you can ask coding questions, you’ll meet amazing friends, share [projects you’re building](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com), and so much more. Most members start with little to no coding experience, join our Slack, build projects of their own, start clubs at their school, attend & later organize [hackathons](https://hackathons.hackclub.com).

Hack Club was founded by [a teenager](https://zachlatta.com) who dropped out of high school because the school system wasn’t working. We’re an entirely open source organization—[our website](https://github.com/hackclub/site) to even [our finances](https://bank.hackclub.com/hq) are public. It’s backed by everyone from [Elon Musk](https://hackclub.com/elon/) to the co-founder of GitHub, [Tom Preston-Werner](https://hackclub.com/preston-werner/).

## Contributing to [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request with code changes, or open issues for suggestions or bug reports. In order to properly contribute first check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) which contains a set of guidelines which any contributions to any Hack Club repository must follow. 

To make things easier on how to select a project to work on, we have made an [open source](https://github.com/hackclub/contribute) [website](https://contribute.hackclub.com/) that helps with the process!  

If you need any help, please feel free to contact us at team@hackclub.com or on our [Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack).

1. Check out our [public issues board][0]. If your issue isn't on the board, [open a new one][1].
2. Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it. First-time contributors should look for the "[first-timers-only][2]" label on issues.
3. Fork the project ([Need help forking a project?][3]). You’ll do all of your work on your forked copy.
4. Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work on that branch ([Need help with branching?][4]).
5. Name the branch something like `fixes-xxx-issue` or `add-xxx-feature` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
6. Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to Hack Club's `main` branch. We'll do a quick review and give you feedback.
