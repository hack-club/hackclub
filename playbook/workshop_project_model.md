# Club Structure

People seem to be more motivated when they get to choose what they do.
Therefore, a Hack Club would ideally be formatted like a maker space. Hack Club
would be a space for people to come in and hack on projects together. However
this does not work for complete beginners because they don't know where to
start.

One solution is only to teach them the basics through lessons or workshops for
the first several months. That's about as exciting as math teachers saying you
have to take years of math before you get to do anything interesting with it. We
want beginners to be able to build their own project as soon as possible.
Therefore we want them to learn just enough and then as soon as possible, have
them actually build their own project. This builds confidence and motivation in
beginners.

At [Hack Camp](https://camp.hackedu.us/), we repeated a 2-day cycle where:

1. learners spend the first 2 hours of their first day following a workshop
2. for the remainder of the first day and all of the second day, they would
   come up with and build their own projects [the details are documented here](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/blob/master/cohort_4/playbook/SCHEDULE.md).

We think a similar division can work for clubs:

**Workshop Time**

Have one club meeting where a beginning hacker learns to ship a project by
following a tutorial.

**Project Time**

Let them work on their own project at the 1-3 club meetings before starting
their next tutorial.

## Workshop Time F.A.Q

### So should my workshops be lecture based?

Most likely not. People learn differently and at different rates. If you just
talk at them, that might work for one person in the room but everyone else will
need you to go faster and slower.

There should be no point ever in a club where this is one person speaking for
more than 10 minutes in a row or else people get bored.

### So what should I do?

Our workshops can be found
[here](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/playbook/workshops)

They are designed so that by the end of every workshop, you can ship something
tangible that you would want to show your friends.

There should be a new workshop released every week.

### Should everyone be working on the same workshop?

People will want to work on different things and work at different rates.
Let them.

## Project Time Pro Tips

### "I don't know what to do?"

Many people, when asked what project they want to work on, say they don't know.

Doing a brainstorming session before this helps a lot.
[Here is an example](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/blob/master/cohort_4/playbook/ACTIVITIES.md#running-a-brainstorm-session)
of how you might run a brainstorming session.
