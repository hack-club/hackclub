# Playbook

This directory contains the playbook under development. A series of workshops
for use in club meetings exists in the [`workshops`](workshops/) directory.

The playbook will eventually also cover general facilitation guidelines. For
now, many clubs are creating [case studies](../case_studies) of what they're
doing in each meeting. Once patterns become clear for what's working across
clubs, those patterns will be centralized in the playbook.

## A preliminary clubs model

Here is a preliminary model that your club can follow.
