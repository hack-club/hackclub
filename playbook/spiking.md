# Teaching Guidelines

Getting the group to respond

## 2

## 1. Try asking for answers that require confirmation

When you ask "Was everyone able to do X?", people don't answer because X
Instead try asking "Raise your hand if you did (or didn't) do X".

| Effective | Ineffective |

| ""        |             |
|           |             |
|           |             |

## 2. Try asking for a visual response that requires a response from everyone instead of an auditory one

If you ask "Can I get a thumbs up if you filled out the feedback form"
