# Ajar.io

---

[Agar.io](http://agar.io) is a popular game built for the web with [HTML, CSS, and Javascript](https://www.quora.com/Difference-between-HTML-XML-PHP-CSS-and-JavaScfdffdript-in-layman-terms). The goal of this workshop is to teach you to make your own simplistic version of agar.io.

The workshop will be divided into several parts:

- __Part 1__ – display the user's cell on screen.
- __Part 2__ – make the user's cell follow the mouse cursor.
- __Part 3__ – add randomly generated food.
- __More coming soon...__

## Part 1

---

In this part you're going to learn to display the user's cell on-screen using the [HTML `<canvas>` element](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp).

> The HTML `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).

> The `<canvas>` element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.

> Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

My the end of this part you'll have something that looks like this:
