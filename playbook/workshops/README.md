# Workshops

Below a list of all of our workshops.

Our workshops aim to:

- be targeted towards beginners and also accommodate for the more experienced.
- be focused on building something fun that you want share with your friends.
- get something shipped as quickly as possible.
- be modular enough to not feel like you have to go through them linearly.
- work well when done in pairs or individually.
- be tinkerable.

We recommend workshops links be provided to students, with each student working
on the workshops independently and receiving support when needed.

Each workshop is a markdown file and has associated facilitation guidelines.

See our general workshop facilitation guidelines
[here](workshop_details.md#general-workshop-facilitation-guidelines):

Our workshops are free to be used by anyone. If you see any issues,

yet, make a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!
