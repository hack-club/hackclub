# GitHub

GitHub is a website used by many professional coders to collaborate on code.
Think Dropbox, but for code.

GitHub also has a login feature similar to how Facebook has "Facebook login".
Let's make a GitHub account so we can login to websites like JS Bin, Cloud9, and
many others in the programming ecosystem!

## Signup for GitHub
