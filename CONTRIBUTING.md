# Contributing to hackEDU

Contributions to hackEDU are very welcome, and strongly encouraged (even to this
document)!

## Doing it

We use a modified version of
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) at hackEDU. The only
difference is instead of deploying from a reviewed pull request, we merge first
and deploy straight from master.

Part of the GitHub Flow is submitting pull requests. See
https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ for a good overview of
what pull requests are and how to use them. Internally, we use the _shared
repository model_ for collaborative development, though we encourage external
contributors to contribute through the _fork & pull model_ and assign a member
of the core team to review the pull request.

When contributing, please pay attention to the commit format of other commits in
the repository.

### Style Guides

If a style guide exists for the language you're contributing in, please do the
maintainers of the repository a favor and follow it. If you notice anything that
deviates from our style guide, don't hesitate to submit a pull request to fix
it. It's very appreciated!

Our existing style guides:

- [Markdown](https://github.com/hackedu/meta/blob/master/markdown_style_guide.md)

## Naming conventions

### Branch names

Branch names should adhere to the following:

- All lowercase
- `-` as space separator for branch names

### File names

File names should follow the following guidelines:

- All lowercase
- `_` as space separator for file names
- `-` as a space separator for dates in file names
- Dates in `YY-MM-DD` format

## Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub's built in issue tracker for nearly everything at hackEDU. We
recommend reading through https://guides.github.com/features/issues/ to get a
good idea of how to use GitHub Issues.

In addition to using vanilla GitHub Issues, we use kanban to manage our team's
workflow (see http://leankit.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/ for a good overview of
what kanban is). To do that with GitHub Issues, we use a neat tool called
[ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/) to organize our GitHub Issues on a kanban
board. If you go to any of our repos with ZenHub installed, you should see a
"Boards" button on the right sidebar, right under the "Code" button. If you
click it, you'll see our issues organized on a real-time kanban board.

## Getting to know git

If you aren't already familiar with git, here's a couple links we recommend
going through:
